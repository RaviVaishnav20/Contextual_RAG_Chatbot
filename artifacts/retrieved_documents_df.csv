It explains the recommended approach and best practices for procurement operations. Figure 1: Procurement Framework STANDARDS GUIDELINES ## Definition of the Procurement The Procurement is the support function that ensures identification, sourcing, and access to optimal goods, services and projects that the government entities and its End-users require to fulfil their objectives. The Procurement exists to explore supply market opportunities and to ensure optimal implementation of the sourcing strategies that deliver the best possible supply outcomes for the government entity. The Procurement adds value and helps the government entity accomplish its objectives by deploying a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and address its needs collaboratively. The Procurement is executed through a series of activities spanning entire supply cycle from the understanding of requirements and evaluating the need for them, through identifying and analysing potential supply options, up to contracting with Suppliers and fulfilment of contracts. The Procurement runs continuously with ongoing management of relationships with the End-users, the Legal and the Finance, monitoring supply contracts and performance of Suppliers. ## Core Principles The Core Principles define key values and approaches for the effectiveness of the Procurement. The Procurement Practitioners of the government entity and every supplier engaged by it in procurement operations must adhere to the Core Principles when representing the government entity. The Procurement Framework establishes the following ten integrated Core Principles: - A Ability Develop procurement workforce with right capacity, capabilities and knowledge ensuring professionalism while providing attractive, competitive career options - B Accountability Support accountability through the establishment or enhancement of authorities and ensure internal and external control mechanisms are coordinated and integrated into procurement operations - C Digital Promote digital technologies and facilitate their adoption and development by enabling access to innovations and emerging digital solutions - D Effectiveness Drive cost-effectiveness and improvement in performance of the Procurement through economies of scale, specialisation, and continuous assessment - E Excellence Deliver efficiency and achieve greater value for money and high level of control through the development of streamlined processes and tools - F Fairness Facilitate access to procurement opportunities for potential Suppliers through establishing a fair regulatory framework and implementing transparency and open-door attitude - G Integration Support integration of the Procurement with relevant organisational functions
