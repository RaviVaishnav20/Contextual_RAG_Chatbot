All UAE government entities and other entities identified as critical 1 by NESA are obligated to implement these Standards. However, NESA highly recommends all entities in the UAE to adopt these Standards on a voluntary basis, as applicable, in order to participate in raising the nation minimum-security levels. 1 The process for NESA to designate an entity as 'critical' is outlined in the UAE Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) Policy produced by NESA. ## 1.2 ## 1.2 PURPOSE OF THE UAE IA STANDARDS The purpose of the UAE IA Standards is to provide requirements to raise the minimum level of protection of information assets and supporting systems across all implementing entities in the UAE, as outlined in Section 2.1. ## In particular, the UAE IA Standards provides: - Description of how information assurance is achieved at the national, sector, and entity levels - Enable a risk-based approach for the implementation of these Standards - Outline of the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders for the planning, development, implementation, and ongoing monitoring and improvement of these Standards - Reference catalog of common information security controls to defend against common threats that exploit known cyber security vulnerabilities - Realization for sectorial requirements through the provision of specialized controls to address sector-specific information assurance requirements - Phased implementation approach to address the most common threats, facilitate the incremental adoption of these Standards, and optimize the value realized through implementation - Definition of compliance from the perspective of these Standards and describe the approach that will be adopted by NESA to assess compliance - Enabler for inter-entity and cross-sector communication to support information sharing and build national situational awareness In summary, the implementation - of these Standards will serve to improve the IA protection level - of the UAE critical information infrastructure. As such, this - document serves as the national UAE IA Standards that - implementing entities have to demonstrate compliance with. ## 1.3 ## LAYOUT OF THE UAE IA STANDARDS This section provides an overview of the layout of the UAE IA Standards to guide the readability of this document.

This chapter also describes how information assurance requirements are addressed at the national, sector, and entity levels following a lifecycle approach to progress the adoption and evolution of information assurance in the UAE. ## CHAPTER 3: UAE IA STANDARDS IMPLEMENTATION This chapter outlines the implementation guidance for entities applying the UAE IA Standards. To help guide the implementation of these Standards, this chapter also provides an overview of the risk-based approach for the identification of applicable controls to be implemented in order to address risks in a manner commensurate with their potential impact. Moreover, this chapter outlines the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders to provide clarity on how to plan, develop, implement, monitor, improve, and report on the implementation of these Standards. Lastly, this chapter concludes by outlining critical success factors for the effective implementation of these Standards. ## CHAPTER 4: COMPLIANCE WITH THE UAE IA STANDARDS This chapter provides a definition of compliance with respect to the requirements of these Standards, and outlines the approach that NESA will follow when evaluating compliance. ## CHAPTER 5: SECURITY CONTROLS This chapter details the management and technical security controls, and describes the prioritization approach for implementing these controls, to guide the gradual and phased implementation of these Standards. ## CHAPTER 6: ANNEXES This chapter provides key reference tools to help stakeholders understand and utilize the security controls including: grouping of controls by priority, cross-referencing of controls to equivalent controls in other key IA standards, mapping of controls against common threats they help to manage, and listing the controls that contain sector and national level requirements. Lastly, this chapter enhances the clarity of the document by providing terms and definitions and a bibliography. ## CHAPTER 7: APPENDICES The appendices are designed to augment the common information assurance requirements (applicable to all sectors) with sector-specific requirements for all critical sectors as outlined in the UAE CIIP Policy. 16 ## 2.1 SCOPE The UAE IA Standards provides management and technical information security controls (henceforth referred to as 'security controls') for entities to establish, implement, maintain, and continuously improve information assurance. NESA will designate the critical entities, as per the UAE CIIP Policy, mandated to implement the UAE IA Standards and apply its requirements to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information or data, and the systems and processes used for those purposes. This includes information in physical or electronic form that may be owned, leased, or otherwise in the possession, custody, or control of the entities. 2.2 ## RELATED NESA DOCUMENTS The UAE IA Standards are critical element of the National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS). Given this, these Standards rely on related and complementary policies issued under the NCSS. Table 1 below describes",

The UAEIA Standards address these requirements by embedding respective Information Sharing security controls that UAEentities will implement. | ## 2.3 ## ENTITY, SECTOR, AND NATIONAL CONTEXTS The entity, sector, and national contexts refer to the integrated relationships and interactions among individual sector entities, sector regulators, and NESA to form sector and national level views on prevailing IA requirements, corresponding adequacy of IA capabilities, and on-going situational awareness. While IA Standards that exist today prescribe requirements for the entity level, they do not take into account the IA issues that emerge from the systemic interconnectivity of entities at the sector and national levels. This leads to two key shortcomings: first, continued exposure to security threats that no single entity is able to address individually (such as Advanced Persistent Threats), and second, an isolated approach to handling risks related to inter-sector dependencies, often leading to increased efforts, cost, and risk exposure of concerned sectors. The UAE IA Standards includes minimum IA requirements and capabilities for UAE entities to integrate into the Sector and National Contexts (refer to Figure 2). ## FIGURE 2: NATIONAL, SECTOR AND ENTITY CONTEXT KEY INFORMATION IS ESCALATED FOR ANALYSIS AT THE SECTOR AND NATIONAL LEVELS RELEVANT THREAT AND RISK INFORMATION IS COMMUNICATED TO SECTOR REGULATORS AND ENTITIES The development of the sector and national contexts relies on the consolidation and analysis of key entity level information, in particular relating to the state of the UAE IA Standards implementation, risk assessment outcomes, as well as information relating to cyber security threats, risks and incidents. 2 To enable the sector and national contexts, entities are required to submit UAE IA Standards implementation progress and key cyber security information to sector regulators, who consolidate and analyze the information to form a sector view of risks and assess the state",

Similarly, sector regulators are required to submit the analyzed sector-level information to NESA, to form the national views on critical risks, situational awareness and state of these Standards implementation across sectors. Having formed the national view of risks and state of these Standards implementation, NESA shares relevant risk and UAE IA Standards implementation best practices with the sector regulators to enhance the effectiveness of these Standards implementation, as well as the cyber incident management and the cyber risk management programs. Similarly, sector regulators share key risk and implementation related information with relevant entities to progress the implementation of these Standards, and enhance the effectiveness of the incident management and risk management programs. In summary, the UAE IA Standards is designed to avoid the isolation created by a single-entity approach to IA, hence creating a stronger and more integrated approach for national information assurance. ## INFORMATION ASSURANCE LIFECYCLE The UAE IA Standards promotes a lifecycle approach for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continuously improving information assurance. This lifecycle approach ensures continual improvement of the UAE's information assurance capabilities based on well-defined activities: - A. UNDERSTANDING an entity's and / or sector's information security requirements and the need to establish a policy and objectives for information security - B. CONDUCTING risk assessments, identifying appropriate risk treatment actions, and selecting controls to manage the risks - C. IMPLEMENTING and operating security controls to manage information security risks in the context of the entity's or sector's overall business risks - D. MONITORING and reviewing the performance and effectiveness of the information security processes and controls - E. ENSURING continual improvement based on objective measurements The continuous improvement aspect of the IA lifecycle ensures that IA capabilities are continuously adapted and evolved in line with changing requirements. The application of the IA lifecycle is facilitated best when integrated in the planning and governance activities of an entity or sector. 24 ## 3.1 OVERVIEW The purpose of this chapter is to explain key concepts related to the implementation of the UAE IA Standards such as the risk-based approach to information assurance and the applicability and prioritization of security controls. This chapter also highlights key stakeholder roles and responsibilities for the effective adoption and progression of the UAE IA Standards, and it lists critical implementation success factors. The implementation of these Standards is meant to complement any existing information assurance programs at implementing entities. This Standard represents the sole point of reference for compliance against its requirements, as measured by the criteria associated with each of its security controls. ## 3.2 ## RISK-BASED APPROACH In today's world, the cyber threat landscape is evolving rapidly at a pace where entities are challenged to keep up with the number and variety of threats. In the face of this growing threat landscape, entities need to adopt practical measures to defend their critical information and information infrastructure against their most critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threats. To this end, a risk-based approach provides entities with a pragmatic mean to identify their most critical vulnerabilities that could expose them",

Adopting a risk-based approach ensures that security controls are instituted in accordance with current risk assessments commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the impact that could result if critical information assets are compromised. The risk-based approach briefly outlined in these Standards summarizes a systematic methodology for identifying, estimating, evaluating, and treating identified entity-level risks. It consists of eight key activities as illustrated in Figure 3. ## FIGURE 3: THE RISK-BASED APPROACH PROCESS Performing a risk management is a key step towards the implementation of the UAE IA Standards as it helps entities identify, prioritize, and measure the effectiveness of the security controls that are needed to treat identified entity-specific risks. Critical entities implementing these Standards shall also refer to the National Cyber Risk Management Framework (NCRMF) which highlights the National Risk Management approach and process of Critical Information Infrastructure. ## ACTIVITY 1: ESTABLISHING THE ENVIRONMENT The risk assessment process should be initiated by establishing objectives, strategies, scope and parameters of the activities of the entity, or those parts of the entity where the risk management process is being applied. Further, criteria for assessing risks should be established in line with the entity's objectives, available resources, and the magnitude of impact that could result from the compromise of confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of information assets. Topics such as authenticity and non-repudiation could also be considered based on the entity context. ## ACTIVITY 2: RISK IDENTIFICATION The entity should identify sources of risk, areas of impacts, events and their causes, and the potential consequences. The aim of this step is to generate a comprehensive list of risks based on the identified information security requirements. Because a risk that is not identified at this stage will not be included in further analysis, comprehensive identification is critical. ## ACTIVITY 3: RISK ESTIMATION Risk estimation involves consideration of the causes and sources of risk in the form of threats and vulnerabilities, their impacts in terms of consequences of a loss of confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of information, and the likelihood that the potential impacts will occur. The risk should also take into account the effectiveness and efficiency of existing controls in addressing the current level of risk. ## ACTIVITY 4: RISK EVALUATION Risk evaluation involves comparing the level of risk found during the risk estimation activity with risk criteria established at the beginning of the process as part of establishing the context (Activity 1). The objective is to determine which risks are outside acceptable parameters and therefore require treatment. ## ACTIVITY 5: RISK TREATMENT For each of the risks identified in the risk assessment, a number of treatment options can be considered and applied either individually, or in combination, for treating the risk. There are several options that are usually considered for treating risks; these options include: - Risk Reduction - Reducing the risk by applying security controls. The selection of security controls should follow a risk-based approach by apply the first set of security controls that treat the highest risks identified during the Risk Evaluation (See 3.4 Prioritization",

    {
        "chunk_content": "of Controls). - Risk Retention - Accepting the risk based on the entity's risk accepting criteria. - Risk Avoidance - Avoiding the activity or condition causing the risk. - Risk Transfer - Transferring the risk to another party. ## ACTIVITY 6: RISK ACCEPTANCE The risk acceptance is the decision to accept residual risk by the management of the entity. The management based on the acceptance criteria should review and approve the treat plan and the residual risk. ## ACTIVITY 7: RISK MONITORING AND REVIEW The results of the risk assessment and treatment process need to be monitored and reviewed for ongoing risk management, and to ensure their continued suitability. The monitoring and review of information security risks should be a planned part of the risk management process, and involve regular checking or surveillance as well as improvements when significant changes occur. The entity's monitoring and review processes should encompass all aspects of the risk management process, including the risk criteria, the identified assets, threats, risks, risk treatment options and security controls. ## ACTIVITY 8: RISK COMMUNICATION AND CONSULTATION Communication and consultation with key stakeholders should take place during all stages of the risk management process. Therefore, plans for communication and consultation should be developed at an early stage. These should address issues relating to the risk itself, its causes, its consequences (if known), and the measures being taken to treat it. Effective external and internal communication and consultation should take place to ensure that stakeholders and those accountable for implementing the risk management process understand the basis on which decisions are made, as well as the reasons why particular actions are required. ## 3.3 ## APPLICABILITY OF CONTROLS The concept of Applicability relates to the identification of security controls for treating entity-specific risks as outlined in [Step 5] of the risk assessment process described above (section 3.2). The security controls included in these Standards are developed to treat a typical entity risk profile developed based on benchmark risk registers. While this common risk profile is widely applicable to implementing entities, NESA recognizes that entity risk profiles do differ based on their specific business and operational context. Given these differences, not all security controls provided in these Standards might be applicable to all entities. Therefore, these Standards require that the identification of the security controls be based on an entity risk assessment resulting in applicable security controls for the treatment of identified risks. Prior to performing the risk assessment process, an entity should consider all security controls to be applicable. However, an individual entity may exclude some security controls on the basis of the risk assessment outcomes, provided that adequate justification is submitted to NESA. Moreover, certain security controls included in these Standards represent requirements for instituting foundational IA capabilities within an entity, and as such, are considered 'Always Applicable'. Given their foundational role, the 'Always Applicable' security controls shall be implemented by each relevant entity regardless of its risk assessment outcomes (refer to Annex 1 for a summary of 'Always Applicable' controls). - In summary, the concept of Applicability identifies the security",

The prioritization approach of the UAE IA Standards is based on the relative impact of security controls in helping implementing entities to: 1 \u00b7 Mitigate common threats \u00b7 Build foundational IA capabilities Based on these criteria, the security controls are grouped into four priority levels - P1, P2, P3, and P4 in this order of importance - and the outcome of the prioritization is included in Annex 2. While all the applicable security controls across the four priority levels are mandatory for critical entities implementing these Standards, they are required to begin implementing these Standards with P1 security controls given their highest relative impact in protecting against critical threats and building foundational information assurance capabilities. 2 Critical entities implementing these Standards may alter (promote or demote) the suggested priority of controls based on the outcomes of their risk assessment, with the exception of top priority controls (P1), which if applicable, may be augmented but never reduced (refer to Figure 4). ## FIGURE 4: CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW OF PRIORITIZATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS",

Within the context of this Standard, compliance refers to the comparison between the requirements outlined in this Standard and the actual state of implementation of these requirements within an entity. This can be measured on an individual control basis, as well as the degree of compliance of an entity overall with the complete set of requirements. Increasing the level of compliance with the security controls provided in this Standard is the key to ensuring immediate and long lasting improvements of information assurance within the UAE and the overall success of the UAE's Information Assurance program. To this end, NESA will ensure that an effective compliance monitoring scheme is in place which provides NESA with the visibility of the current status of compliance with this Standard and the activities needed for improving the overall security of the UAE's cyberspace. The compliance monitoring scheme is outlined in the UAE NIAF Governance and is based on the following four elements: ## CONTROLS All security controls specified in the UAE IA Standards need to be considered by each entity, and any entity wishing to claim compliance with these Standards shall implement these controls based on the following requirements: - Controls that are 'Always Applicable' - these security controls are essential and shall be implemented by any entity wishing to claim compliance with the UAE IA Standards. Omission of any of these controls is not acceptable and constitutes non-conformity. - Controls that are applicable based on the risk assessment - the entity shall determine which of the security controls provided in the UAE IA Standards are applicable in its particular situation based on the results of the risk assessment. Any exclusion of these controls needs to be justified and evidence needs to be provided such that the associated risks have been accepted by accountable persons or authorizing entities. The overall set of security controls that are 'Always Applicable' and those security controls that have been determined as being applicable based on the risk assessment are 'mandatory' for the entity to implement, and will be the basis of the compliance monitoring scheme. ## SUB-CONTROLS For each of the security controls, a set of sub-controls are specified. These sub-controls specify mandatory implementation requirements. Also, it is expected that each entity claiming compliance shall implement the selected security controls by complying with the sub-controls during the implementation process as described below. The entity shall implement all of the sub-controls of the 'Always Applicable' security controls. Omission of any of these sub-controls is not acceptable and constitutes nonconformity to the UAE IA Standards. The entity can decide to not implement a sub-control of a security control identified by the risk assessment, if this action is appropriately justified (e.g. following the risk assessment or due to decisions or circumstances in the entity), or",

Any deviation from the sub-controls needs to be justified and evidence needs to be provided such that the associated risks have been accepted by accountable persons or authorizing entities. ## PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Performance indicators are intended to provide entities implementing the UAE IA Standards with some basic guidelines to measure the quality and effectiveness of its compliance with the control sub-families and controls of this Standard. Entities implementing this Standard can deviate from these performance indicators, but are required to provide a reason for this deviation and to specify the new performance indicators when doing so. For compliance with this Standard, entities need to use performance indicators to measure the quality and effectiveness of the implemented security controls. ## AUTOMATION, THREAT/VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION FOR SUB-FAMILIES OF CONTROLS, AND IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR CONTROLS The information on possible automation and the implementation guidance for security controls are provided for information purposes only and can be implemented as the entity prefers, without any further explanation or justification. Descriptions of typical threats and vulnerabilities are also provided for information purposes. In summary, NESA places a high level of importance on understanding and improving the level of compliance with this Standard as one of the core elements of increasing the level of success of the UAE's information assurance program. At the same time, NESA understands that individual entities face specific circumstances that require a certain level of flexibility to manage properly. As such, this Standard aims to strike an appropriate balance of mandatory requirements versus suggested security controls. This is based on the risk-based approach that each entity shall develop internally in order to make appropriate and justified decisions. Moreover, all implementing entities are welcomed and encouraged to share their experience in regard to the implementation of the security controls. 44 ## 5.1 ## CONTROL STRUCTURE The hierarchy of control families, control sub-families and individual controls are structured as follows: ## CONTROL FAMILY STRUCTURE | CONTROL FAMILYNUMBER | CONTROLFAMILYNAME | |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------| | OBJECTIVE | High level objective of the control family | | PERFORMANCE INDICATOR | Metrics that measure the effectiveness of the control family | ## SUB-FAMILY STRUCTURE | CONTROL SUB-FAMILYNAME | CONTROLSUB-FAMILYNUMBER | |------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | OBJECTIVE | High level objective of the control sub-family | | PERFORMANCE INDICATOR | Metrics that measure the effectiveness of the control sub-family | | AUTOMATION GUIDANCE | Description of procedures and / or tools to automate the implementation of the control sub-family | | RELEVANTTHREATS ANDVULNERABILITIES | The most prevalent and damaging attack types against which the control sub-family ensures protection | ## CONTROL STRUCTURE | CONTROL NUMBER | | PRIORITY | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | | |---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | | CONTROLNAME | APPLICABILITY | IDENTIFIESCONTROLS THATAREALWAYS APPLICABLEAND CONTROLSTHATARE APPLICABLEUNLESS OTHERWISEJUSTIFIED BYTHEENTITY'SRISK ASSESSMENTPROCESS | IDENTIFIESCONTROLS THATAREALWAYS APPLICABLEAND CONTROLSTHATARE APPLICABLEUNLESS OTHERWISEJUSTIFIED BYTHEENTITY'SRISK ASSESSMENTPROCESS | IDENTIFIESCONTROLS THATAREALWAYS APPLICABLEAND CONTROLSTHATARE APPLICABLEUNLESS OTHERWISEJUSTIFIED BYTHEENTITY'SRISK ASSESSMENTPROCESS | IDENTIFIESCONTROLS THATAREALWAYS APPLICABLEAND CONTROLSTHATARE APPLICABLEUNLESS OTHERWISEJUSTIFIED BYTHEENTITY'SRISK ASSESSMENTPROCESS | IDENTIFIESCONTROLS THATAREALWAYS APPLICABLEAND CONTROLSTHATARE APPLICABLEUNLESS OTHERWISEJUSTIFIED BYTHEENTITY'SRISK ASSESSMENTPROCESS | | CONTROL | Control statement (e.g. The allocation and",

It is necessary to include templates for document management in all documentation, irrespective of the form it takes. All this can be supported by using document management systems and other controls to technically ensure that the necessary actions are carried out, wherever it is possible, it is recommended to use technical support to achieve a complete implementation. Compliance with this control should be checked every so often, and non-compliances should be reacted to, to demonstrate that this actually is an important control everybody needs to comply with. Particular attention should be given to the protection of records - it is not so important for records to have an author (they are often system based- and a change history (they should not change at all if they are supposed to provide evidence), but the date of issue and the integrity of the record are important items to maintain. ## M2 INFORMATION SECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT | M2 | INFORMATIONSECURITYRISKMANAGEMENT | |------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | OBJECTIVE | Toensure that information security risks in the entity are identified, assessed and -evaluated, and that these risks are treated in accordance with the information security",

INFORMATION : Databases, files, contracts and agreements, system documentation, research information, user manuals, training material, operational or support procedures, etc. - B. SOFTWARE ASSETS: Application software, system software, development tools, and utilities - C. PHYSICAL ASSETS: Computer equipment, communications equipment, removable media - D. OTHER EQUIPMENT - E. SERVICES: Computing and communications services, general utilities, e.g. heating, lighting, power, and air-conditioning - F. PEOPLE , and their qualifications, skills, and experience - G. INTANGIBLES , such as reputation and image of the entity The identified assets are summarized in the Asset Inventory (refer to T1.2.1). It might be useful to summarize assets in suitable groups (e.g. all PCs in a call center, processing the same type of information), but care should be taken to only group 'like with like' when doing so. It is also helpful to take account of business processes, as they often can help to understand the information flow and how assets are working in the entity. ## IDENTIFICATION OF THREATS Threats are not very dependent on the entity and its business; they are just out there trying to succeed. When identifying threats, it can be helpful to use threat lists (e.g. those provided in this Standard, or in other standards, such as ISO/IEC 27005), and to look into incident reports (incidents are always related to threats that have been successful- and audit reports, and to keep an open mind to the latest development as new threats will continue to emerge. It is also important to not only look at threats from the outside, such as hackers or malware, but also consider inside threats. A disgruntled employee with given access rights can often do more damage as outsiders. ## IDENTIFICATION OF VULNERABILITIES The identification of vulnerabilities should be based on an assessment of the existing controls. To do so, it is recommended to conduct a gap analysis, which checks the controls in place against this Standard. The results of the gap analysis form an input in the identification of vulnerabilities as well as into the assessment of the risk likelihood (see also M2.2.2 below). Any control, which has been identified as missing, not completely in place, not fully documented or not complied with identifies at least one (if not more- vulnerabilities, which might be exploited by the identified threats. PLEASE NOTE: The identification of threats and vulnerabilities takes place per each identified asset, so this easily produces a lot of information. To keep the amount of information manageable, it is recommended to: - A. Identify threats and vulnerabilities with the existing controls in mind - B. Identify only threat/vulnerability pairs where the threat will actually exploit the vulnerability 3.

Consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity or availability: The first part of assessing the consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity or availability is to identify the business importance the information asset under consideration has. Damage to an asset that is important for the business is much likelier to cause severe consequences than an asset that is not as important. Based on the business use of the asset, the consequences for a loss of the following needs to be assessed: - A. CONFIDENTIALITY This means the information asset is only accessible to those authorized to access it - B. INTEGRITY This means the information asset has not been modified in any unauthorized way - C. AVAILABILITY This means the information asset is available, when needed To make the results of this assessment comparable, scales should be used, which should have been defined in the Information Security Risk Management Policy (see M2.1.1 above). The assessment of these consequences should be done together with the business users of the information assets, as these can give important input into the process because they are aware of the security requirements for their assets. This can be done by interviews and/or questionnaires, but it is important to ensure that the business users understand what is asked from them. As a result, each asset should have identified consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity and availability.. ## LIKELIHOOD OF THREAT/VULNERABILITY COMBINATIONS The input into the assessment of the likelihood that a particular threat exploits a vulnerability is based on very similar considerations as the identification of threats and vulnerabilities (see M2.2.1 above). The likelihood of a threat occurring can be derived from threat catalogues and statistics, as well as incident records, audit logs and reports, etc. the entity has produced. The level of vulnerability is based on how good or bad the controls are that have been put in place, so this can also be derived from the results of the gap analysis (see M2.2.1 above). Finally, the likelihood of the threat to occur and the level of vulnerability are put together to determine the likelihood that this particular threat/vulnerability combination occurs. How exactly these values are put together has been defined in the Information Security Risk Management Policy (see M2.1.1. above). Determining the levels of risk: Based on the method to calculate risks, which has been chosen by the entity and has been documented in the Information Security Risk Management Policy (see M2.1.1. above), the risks should now be calculated using the consequences and likelihoods that have been assessed.

This will rank the risks in order of severity and will identify those that are acceptable (because they are below the general threshold of acceptance), and those risks that will require treatment. If necessary, the entity can assign additional priorities to the risks, e.g. if a risk - despite of not being high- relates to a very vital business process. Any such assignment is entirely up to the entity, any decisions made should be reasoned and documented. Decisions on risks should take account of the wider context of the risk and include consideration of the requirements of other parties, such as sector, regional or national initiatives.

A number of treatment options can and should be considered and applied either individually or in combination. When selecting risk treatment options, the entity should consider the expectations of the sector and national level. Though equally effective, some risk treatments can be more acceptable to some stakeholders than to others. The selected risk treatment options should be documented in the risk treatment plan. The treatment plan should clearly identify the priority order in which individual risk treatments should be implemented. Risk treatment itself can introduce risks. A significant risk can be the failure or ineffectiveness of the risk treatment measures.

Consideration should be given to the possibility of deterioration of media used for storage of records. Storage and handling procedures should be implemented in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. For long term storage, the use of paper and microfiche should be considered. Where electronic storage media are chosen, procedures to ensure the ability to access data (both media and format readability) throughout the retention period should be included, to safeguard against loss due to future technology change. Data storage systems should be chosen such that required data can be retrieved in an acceptable timeframe and format, depending on the requirements to be fulfilled. The system of storage and handling should ensure clear identification of records and of their retention period as defined by national or regional legislation or regulations, if applicable. This system should permit appropriate destruction of records after that period if they are not needed by the entity.

Frequency and history of occurrences (repeated occurrences) - C. Seriousness of the impact - D. Root cause for the non-conformity for which the following activities have to be performed - - Collect data - Get expert advice - Consult with vendors, partners and associates The corrective action(s) identified should be implemented within an appropriate timeframe and prioritized based on the risk treatment plan (see M2); delays should be avoided to reduce the negative effects of non-conformities to the information security in place at the entity. It is also important to ensure that the implemented corrective actions achieve their intended objective and are effective. The review of the effectiveness of corrective actions can be done by the Information Security Committee, and the results should be documented.

Classifications and associated protective controls for information should take account of business needs for sharing or restricting information, as well as legal requirements. Assets other than information can also be classified in conformance with classification of information which is stored in, processed by or otherwise handled or protected by the asset. Classification scheme should include conventions for classification and criteria for review of the classification over time; in accordance with some predetermined access control policy. The level of protection in the scheme should be assessed by analyzing confidentiality, integrity and availability and any other requirements for the information considered. Owners of information assets should be accountable for their classification. The scheme should be consistent across the whole entity so that everyone will classify information and related assets in the same way, have a common understanding of protection requirements and apply the appropriate protection. Each level should be given a name that makes sense in the context of the classification scheme's application. Classification should be included in the entity's processes, and consistent and coherent across the entity. Results of classification should indicate value of assets depending on their sensitivity and criticality to the entity, e.g. in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Results of classification should be updated in accordance with changes of their value, sensitivity and criticality through their life-cycle. Classification provides people who deal with information a concise indication of how to handle and protect it. Creating groups of information with similar protection needs and specifying information security procedures that apply to all the information in the group facilitate this. This approach reduces the need for case-by-case risk assessment and custom design of controls. An example of information confidentiality classification scheme could be based on four levels as follows: - A) Disclosure causes no harm - B) Disclosure causes minor embarrassment or minor operational inconvenience - C) Disclosure has a significant short term impact on operations or tactical objectives - D) Disclosure has a serious impact on long term strategic objectives or put the survival of the organization at risk | T1.3.2 | LABELINGOF INFORMATION PRIORITY P3 APPLICABILITY BASEDONRISK ASSESSMENT | |-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | CONTROL | The entity shall label information in accordance with the classification scheme adopted by the entity. | | SUB-CONTROL | The entity shall: 1) Establish a procedure for labeling of information and its related assets in physical or electronic formats to reflect their attributed classification",

Such logging should be activated, with logs sent to centralized logging servers. Firewalls, proxies, and remote access systems (VPN, dial-up, etc.) should all be configured for verbose logging, storing all the information available for logging in the event a follow- up investigation is required. Furthermore, operating systems, especially those of servers, should be configured to create access control logs when a user attempts to access resources without the appropriate privileges. To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an entity should periodically scan through its logs and compare them with the asset inventory in order to ensure that each managed item actively connected to the network is periodically generating logs. Analytical programs such as SIM/SEM solutions for reviewing logs can provide value, but the capabilities employed to analyze audit logs are quite extensive, including, importantly, evenjust a cursory examination by a person. Actual correlation tools can make audit logs far more useful for subsequent manual inspection. Such tools can be quite helpful in identifying subtle attacks. However, these tools are neither a panacea nor a replacement for skilled information security personnel and system administrators.

Based on urgency, potential consequences and technical constraints, it may not be possible for an entity to validate all information before transmission into the information sharing community. Where limitations exist, these should be indicated as part of the message. Also, indicating reservations on credibility of information is particularly important where the source is anonymous or unknown. It is important to indicate where the originator has been able to validate the information given directly, and can vouch for its authenticity. There are technical mechanisms that can be used to provide authenticity without compromising anonymity. For example, shared cryptographic secrets could be used to confirm that a communication originated from a member of the community without revealing the actual identity of the originator. Each recipient should be responsible for obtaining any necessary authorizations for wider release from the originator prior to onwards distribution. In inter-sector communications, the originator may not know who all the entities that receive the information will be. In such a case, a general or specific sector release approval will need to be granted. In addition, all information sharing communities should define rules for the protection of information in transit, and only permit members to join the community if such rules are accepted and implemented by the prospective member. Any supporting entity should implement such rules internally. Information sharing communities should consider implementing alternative mechanisms for information sharing that do not rely on electronic messaging, and enabling members to specify that specific messages are distributed by such other routes. | T4.5 | NETWORKSECURITYMANAGEMENT | |-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | OBJECTIVE | Toensuretheprotectionofinformation in networks andtheprotection of the supportinginfrastructure | | PERFORMANCE INDICATOR | Percentage of information systems that meet all network security management requirements | | AUTOMATION GUIDANCE | Port scanning tools are used on a range of target systems to determine which services are listening on the network.

A graduated set of controls can be applied in different logical network domains to further segregate the network security environments, e.g. publicly accessible systems, internal networks, and critical assets. The domains should be defined based on a risk assessment and the different security requirements within each of the domains. Such a network perimeter can be implemented by installing a secure gateway between the two networks to be interconnected to control access and information flow between the two domains. This gateway should be configured to filter traffic between these domains and to block unauthorized access in accordance with the entity's access control policy. An example of this type of gateway is what is commonly referred to as a firewall. Another method of segregating separate logical domains is to restrict network access by using virtual private networks for user groups within the entity. Networks can also be segregated using the network device functionality, e.g. IP switching. Separate domains can then be implemented by controlling the network data flows using the routing/switching capabilities, such as access control lists. The criteria for segregation of networks into domains should be based on the access control policy and access requirements, and also take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable network routing or gateway technology. In addition, segregation of networks should be based on the value and classification of information stored or processed in the network, levels of trust, or lines of business, in order to reduce the total impact of a service disruption. | T4.5.4 | SECURITYOF WIRELESS NETWORKS PRIORITY P2 APPLICABILITY BASEDONRISK ASSESSMENT | |-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | CONTROL | The entity shall ensure that all wireless networks are adequately secured. | | | The entity shall: 1) Undertake and document a site survey to determine the optimal physical locations to avoid stray signal leaking too far outside of the entity's physical perimeter | | SUB-CONTROL | 2) Identify criteria for grouping information services, users, and information systems into different groups that facilitate segregation on wireless networks | ## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE (FOR INFORMATION PURPOSE ONLY) Consideration should be given to the segregation of wireless networks from internal and private networks.

This should also take into consideration that the entity may have different levels of ability to negotiate these terms with a vendor based on the type of cloud services being purchased (e.g. private vs. public). Part of the entity's responsibility includes understanding, where possible, where information will be stored, processed, or transmitted to ensure that often sensitive information privacy laws and other legal restrictions (e.g. prohibiting transmission of certain types of information outside national borders) are respected. In addition, the entity should ensure that the terms and conditions of service delivery agreements provide ample clarification on how information will be migrated from the selected cloud service provider to another provider (or back to the entity) at the termination of the service delivery agreement.

Results from the identification should be documented merging views of all stakeholders. Security requirements and controls should reflect the business value of the information involved and the potential negative business impact which might result from lack of adequate security. System requirements for information security and processes for implementing security should be integrated in the early stages of information system projects. Controls introduced at the design stage are significantly cheaper to implement and maintain than those included during or after implementation. The sizing of information systems should take into account enabling all security features in that system; i.e. higher specifications model of Security-Systems so that when security features are enabled they do not cause slow-down and degradation in the information systems performance. For applications systems providing services or transferring information over public networks, the system requirements should also consider the following: - A. The level of confidence each party requires in each other's claimed identity, e.g. through authentication - B. Authorization processes associated with who may approve contents of, issuing or signing key transactional documents - C. Ensuring that communicating partners are fully informed of their authorizations for provision or use of the service - D. Determining and meeting requirements for confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and receipt of key documents and the non-repudiation of contracts, e.g. associated with tendering and contract processes - E.

The test schedule for business continuity plan(s) should indicate how and when each element of the plan should be tested. Each element of the plan(s) should be tested frequently. A variety of techniques should be used in order to provide assurance that the plan(s) will operate in real life. These should include: - A. Table-top testing of various scenarios (discussing the business recovery arrangements using example interruptions) - B. Simulations (particularly for training people in their post-incident/crisis management roles) - C. Technical recovery testing (ensuring information systems can be restored effectively) - D. Testing recovery at an alternate site (running business processes in parallel with recovery operations away from the main site) - E. Tests of supplier facilities and services (ensuring externally provided services and products will meet the contracted commitment) - F. Complete rehearsals (testing that the entity, personnel, equipment, facilities, and processes can cope with interruptions) These techniques can be used by any entity. They should be applied in a way that is relevant to the specific recovery plan. The results of tests should be recorded and actions taken to improve the plans, where necessary. Responsibility should be assigned for regular reviews of each business continuity plan. The identification of changes in business arrangements not yet reflected in the business continuity plans should be followed by an appropriate update of the plan. This formal change control process should ensure that the updated plans are distributed and reinforced by regular reviews of the complete plan. Examples of changes where updating of business continuity plans should be considered are acquisition of new equipment, upgrading of systems and changes in: - Personnel - Addresses or telephone numbers - Business strategy - Location, facilities, and resources - Legislation - Contractors, suppliers, and key customers - Processes, or new or withdrawn ones - Risk (operational and financial) Most of this information is derived from a variety of sources, including: - ISO/IEC 27001:2005 'Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management systems - Requirements' - ISO/IEC 27002:2005 'Information technology - Security techniques - Code of practice for Information security management' - ISO/IEC 27005:2005 'Information technology - Security techniques - Information security risk management' - ISO/IEC 27010:2012 'Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management for",

As a recap, sector and national level controls are designed to overcome the silos created by a single-entity approach to IA, and hence create a stronger and more integrated approach for national information assurance. They serve as foundational elements for developing the sector and national views of IA by enabling the integration and analysis of information relating to security threats, risks and incidents, as well as the state of these Standards implementation and risk assessment outcomes. Overall, the UAE IA Standards provides a total of 15 sector and national level controls as outlined in Table 10 below. ## TABLE 10: SECTOR AND NATIONAL LEVEL CONTROLS CONTROL NUMBER CONTROL NAME M1 STRATEGY AND PLANNING M1.3 ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION SECURITY M1.3.3 Contact with Authorities M1.3.4 Contact with Special Interest Groups M5 COMPLIANCE M5.1 COMPLIANCE POLICY M5.1.1 Compliance Policy T3 OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT T3.6 MONITORING T3.6.1 Monitoring Policy and Procedures Annex E Annex | T4 | COMMUNICATIONS | |--------|-----------------------------------------------------------| | T4.4 | INFORMATIONEXCHANGESPROTECTION | | T4.4.1 | Connectivity to Information Sharing Platforms | | T4.4.2 | Information Released into Information Sharing Communities | | T7 | INFORMATIONSYSTEMSACQUISITION,DEVELOPMENT ANDMAINTENANCE | | T7.4 | CRYPTOGRAPHICCONTROLS | | T7.4.1 | Policy onthe Useof Cryptographic Controls | | T7.8 | SUPPLYCHAINMANAGEMENT | | T7.8.1 | Supply Chain Protection Strategy | | T7.8.2 | Supplier Reviews | | T8 | INFORMATIONSECURITYINCIDENTMANAGEMENT | | T8.1 | INFORMATIONSECURITYINCIDENTMANAGEMENTPOLICY | | T8.1.1 | Information Security Incident Response Policy | | T8.2 | MANAGEMENTOFINFORMATIONSECURITYINCIDENTS ANDIMPROVEMENTS | | T8.2.2 | Incident Classification | | T8.3 | INFORMATIONSECURITYEVENTSANDWEAKNESSES REPORTING | | T8.3.1 | Situational Awareness | | T8.3.2 | Reporting Information Security Events | ## TERMS AND DEFINITIONS ## TABLE 11: TERMS AND DEFINITIONS | TERM | DEFINITION | |-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | ASSET | Anything that has value to the organization such as software, information, information systems.\u2074 | | AUDIT | Anindependent review of event logs and related activities performed to determine the adequacy of current security measures, to identify the degree of conformance with established policy or to develop recommendations for improvements to the security measures currently applied | | AUTHENTICATION | Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system. | | AUTHENTICITY | Theproperty of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confidence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or messageoriginator.

Entity Procurement is responsible for procurement of the Entity-Specific Categories including sourcing, contracting, ordering, and managing Supplier performance. The Entity Procurement utilizes the shared services provided by the GPO. The GPO engages stakeholders from the Entities and dedicated Finance , Legal or other resources as needed for procuring Common Categories. The Entity Procurement engages End-Users and dedicated Finance , Legal or other resources for procuring Entity-Specific Categories. ## 1.2.1 Category Classification Classification of a category as a Common Category or an Entity-Specific Category depends on the category spend value and its commonality across Entities. A category that is procured by five or more Entities may be considered as a Common Category. Figure 1.2.2 Common vs. Entity Specific Categories ## 1.2.2 Category Taxonomy Category taxonomy refers to a hierarchical assignment of goods/services. In line with global best practices, UNSPSC (United Nations Standard Products and Services Code) taxonomy is deployed in 'SAP Ariba'. It is a four-level taxonomy with each record represented with an eight-digit number and unique name, illustrated below: ## Figure 1.2.3 UNSPSC Categorizations in 'SAP Ariba modules' The four primary levels of the UNSPSC are Segment, Family, Class, and Commodity. Each level is identified by two digits, that constitute together an overall eight-digit code. All Abu Dhabi DED activities are mapped to Level 2 UNSPSC categories. Suppliers are registered in the Supplier Master Database, maintained by the Department of Government Support (DGS), at Level 2 UNSPSC categories, and line items are created in 'SAP Ariba' at Level 3 UNSPSC categories. ## 1.3 Procurement Capability Model The Procurement Capability Model comprises of four types of procurement capabilities: Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support as illustrated below: | Strategic | Procurement Strategy | Procurement Strategy | Demand and Category Management | Demand and Category Management | |-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------| | Tactical | Source to Contract Contract | Source to Contract Contract | Lifecycle Management | Supplier Performance and Relationship Management | | Operational | Requisition to Pay | Requisition to Pay | Requisition to Pay | Requisition to Pay | | Support | Risk and Regulation | Supplier Master Data Management | Item Master Data Management | User Master Data Management | Figure 1.3.1 Procurement Capability Model ## 1.3.1 Strategic Procurement Capability (Level 1) - 1) Procurement Strategy (Level 2) process group includes procedures to develop strategy for the Procurement function in line with the overall strategy. - 2) Demand and Category Management (Level 2) process group includes procedures to develop 'Category Strategy' to deliver value and drive cost savings, and 'Procurement Plan' to bridge the demand-supply gap. ## 1.3.2 Tactical Procurement Capability (Level 1) - 1) Source to Contract (Level 2) process group",

Baseline principles - 1) An agreed baseline is required for Procurement Benefits calculations and must be signed-off by the relevant stakeholders from the End-User , the Finance and the Procurement . - 2) Baseline could be historic actuals (e.g., prior year spend, budgeted spend, etc.). - 3) The baseline must be supported by one or multiple data sets, such as Accounts Payable (AP) data, Purchase Orders (PO) data, Contracts data, etc. - 4) An appropriate method to calculate the Baseline Spend should be determined for each type of procurement benefit. ## ii. Procurement Benefits calculation principles - 1) Procurement Benefits can be calculated after acceptance of a final, binding offer from one or more Supplier(s) and the acknowledgment of offer conditions (with written confirmation, Letter of Intent, contract amendment, etc.). - 2) Benefits implementation costs (one-time investments) are excluded from the benefits calculation. ## 1.4.3 Calculation Methodologies ## i. Baseline Spend Baseline Spend is based on two parameters and is calculated as following: ## Baseline Spend = Total Volume * Baseline Unit Price Total volume may be known or unknown. However, two methods can be used for calculations to estimate volume, as detailed below: | Method | Situation | Method | |-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Demand Plan Forecast Volume | Forecast is known | \uf0b7 100% of forecast volume for the specific spend area | | Historic forecast volume | Forecast is unknown | \uf0b7 50% of historic volume + (50% of historic volume * category demand growth forecast %) In general, previous year volumes are used as historic volumes; if this data is not available, the period that is used to calculate historic volume should be mentioned. | ## Table 1.4.2 Volume Estimation Methodologies Baseline unit price may be estimated using one of the following methodologies: ## 1) Historic price baseline Historic price baseline is relevant when the goods/services/projects were purchased previously (in last year). Below are the details of various methods to create a historic price baseline: Table 1.4.3 Historic Baseline Price - Calculation Methodologies | Price Method | Situation | Method | |-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Last Price Paid | Used where market is not volatile (applicable for components and traded items like office furniture, etc.). | \uf0b7 Last actual paid price in the Purchase Order (PO), or \uf0b7 Contracted price, if last actual paid price is not available | | Average Price | Used in case of a volatile market (applicable for e.g., 100% index-based commodities) | \uf0b7 Average Price paid over the last year | | Average quoted Market Price | Used in case of a volatile market (Commodities for which transparent and independent index are not available) | \uf0b7 Average Price of historical offers after clarification from the Suppliers | ## 2) Comparable price baseline If a certain goods/service/projects has not been purchased previously, historic price baseline cannot be established. In such cases,",

(e.g., estimating the baseline price for a car rental service by comparing it with similar services previously purchased by another Entity). ## 3) New price baseline If neither a historic nor a comparable baseline can be established, a new baseline can be developed based on the initial RFI or RFP/RFQ responses provided by the Suppliers . The baseline price will be calculated as an average of the approved initial quotes. Any price reductions received through follow-on RFP/ auction/negotiation is considered as benefits. ## ii. Procurement Benefits As illustrated in Table 1.4.1, Procurement Benefits are classified into three buckets: ## 1) Cost Savings Following are the various Cost Savings scenarios: ## a. Standard Method (last paid price - new price) This method is used when the savings result from the difference between baseline and negotiated price. For example, when Suppliers are changed or when similar goods/services are bundled, resulting in a better price per item. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: Savings = (baseline price - negotiated price) * volume ## b. Free of charges Extra These are the savings realized when contracts negotiated with Suppliers include 'extras' that have not been part of the goods/services/projects offering of past purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = Savings from free of charge 'extra' per unit * volume ## c. Fluctuating market price with market Index This method of calculation is used when the cost savings can be attributed to a changing market index that results in a better future price (with respect to the market price). This method is applicable for commodities (crude oil, metals, agri-commodities, etc.) where prices are linked to indices and change frequently. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = Forecasted spend with historical index value - forecasted spend with new index value ## d. Fluctuating market price without market Index This method of calculation is used when there are no market price references available. There may be no good benchmarks to indicate the savings w.r.t the market. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = (Initial offer - negotiated offer) * expected volume ## e. Volume Rebate This method of calculation is used when the Supplier offers rebates on volume or similar incentives, which have not been included in previous purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = (new rebate per unit - old rebate per unit) * volume ## f. Re-engineered specification (substitution) / rationalization For some goods/services/projects, the specification can be changed to reduce the price. New specifications examples may include (but not limited to) using black and white printers instead of coloured printers, using standard cars instead of high-end cars for rentals, and using standard event designs instead of specialized events. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = (Cost for original item/service - cost for substitute item/service) * volume ## g. In-house vs. Outsourcing For some categories,",

Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: Savings = (In-house cost (i.e. labor cost + material cost + overhead cost) - purchase price) x volume ## h. Lease vs. Buy For some categories lease of goods might be a viable alternative to buying (or vice versa). To compare the savings between leasing and buying options for goods, the cost per one unit needs to be calculated and compared. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = (Cost of purchasing per unit - leasing cost per unit) * volume ## i. Reduced Cost of Disposal At the end of their lifetime, some goods (e.g., Laptop) may be recycled. These costs need to be considered to determine the actual price of a product. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = Historic cost for disposal - new cost for disposal ## 2) Cost Avoidance Following are various Cost Avoidance scenario: ## a. Demand reduction/yield improvement This method of calculation is used when the volume of a defined goods/service/projects has been reduced through active negotiations by Procurement , (i.e., demand control). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = (Last volume - negotiated new volume) * last price ## b. Reduced cost of service This method is used to calculate the cost reductions for service (e.g., reduced maintenance cost through introduction of preventive measures). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = (Historic service cost - new service cost) ## 3) Cash Impact Following are the various Cash Impact scenarios: ## a. Inventory reduction This method is used when the involvement of Procurement leads to a reduction of inventories (e.g., stock) and results in significant cost savings. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: Savings = (Old Inventory levels - New Inventory levels) x WACC (WACC - Weighted Average Cost of Capital) ## b. Payment term extension This method is used when the involvement of Procurement results in a change of 'Payment Terms' and leads to a working capital improvement. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: Savings = Working Capital Improvement = Average monthly invoice from supplier (VAT included) * New Payment terms (in days) / 30 * WACC (VAT - Value added tax; WACC - Weighted Average Cost of Capital) ## 1.5 Legislations applicable for Procurement ## 1.5.1 Abu Dhabi Local Content (ADLC) The Abu Dhabi Local Content Program aims to direct government spending towards the development of the local economy in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The tenders published by government entities must ask for the submission of the ICV Certificate, sponsored by the Department of Economic Development of Abu Dhabi. The weight given to the local content must constitute 40% of the overall score allocated to the financial/commercial evaluation score.

The 'Procurement Strategy' aligns procurement activities with the overall Entity strategy and Abu .Dhabi Governmental initiatives The Head of Procurement is responsible for the creation of the Procurement Strategy. The Head of Procurement assigns key members from Procurement to create and monitor execution of the 'Procurement Strategy'. Development of the 'Procurement Strategy' is an offline process. Following are the key steps to develop a 'Procurement Strategy': ## 2.1.1.(I) Step 1 - Internal and External Analysis ## i. Analyze procurement practice The assigned key members conduct an analysis of the Entity Procurement on following aspects to identify procurement optimization initiatives: - 1) People - 2) Processes - 3) Technology - 4) Governance. This leads to a better understanding the Procurement from the perspective of operating processes, organizational excellence, and knowledge and information management. Post this analysis, various models (such as SWOT analysis) can be utilized to identify the key competencies and major areas of improvement. ## ii. Spend analysis In addition to above, spend data may be collated and analysed for additional optimization opportunities. This analysis provides insights into historical spend, Supplier base, and spend categories to identify the focus areas for improvement. ## iii. Market analysis Assigned key members analyse the evolution of markets, trends and conditions to assess their impact on the Procurement . The necessary data may be collected through primary and secondary sources. This data is updated over time, to maintain relevance. Various methodologies, such as Porter's five forces (industry rivalry, buyer power, Supplier power, threat to new entrant, substitution possibilities), TOWS (Threat, Opportunities, Weakness, and Strengths) and PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental) analysis may be used. ## iv. Benchmarking A 'Competitive Assessment', conducted through survey and benchmarking, may show Entity's strengths / weaknesses with respect to industry best practices. The 'Procurement Strategy' addresses the areas of improvements and adjustments required to remain relevant with respect to the changes in the market. ## 2.1.1.(II) Step 2 - Develop Procurement Strategy The 'Procurement Strategy' includes the following: ## i. Vision and Mission The vision and mission of the Procurement is derived from the vision and mission of the Entity. ## ii.

Strategy X Levers | Reference tab; To understand various strategic levers for value generation, to be used in the 'Category Strategy' | ## Table 2.2.3 'Category Strategy' document structure The creation of the 'Category Strategy' consists of following activities: ## a. Step 1 - Undertake Category Segmentation Category Segmentation depends on the following criteria: - a1. Criticality of the Category is determined by factors such as (but not limited to) impact on Entity's operations in case of unavailability, and critical factors such as Health, Safety and Environment. - a2. Complexity of the Category defines the inherent nature of a category that is governed by several factors including (but not limited to) availability of Suppliers, market structure (monopolistic, oligopolistic, competitive etc.), ability to switch Suppliers , possibility of substitution, lead times and regulations governing the category. Based on above parameters, the category may be classified into the following segments: Figure 2.2.5 Category Segmentation ## b. Step 2 - Identify and shortlist Strategic Levers Based on the Category Segmentation, the 'Project Owner' selects the category optimization and improvement strategies (and associated levers). These strategies (and associated levers) are divided into following areas: - b1. Usage and Innovation - refers to opportunities to increase efficiency and innovate by managing demand, optimizing design specifications, and collaborating with strategic Suppliers . - b2. Price - refers to opportunities to reduce purchase price of goods/services/projects by utilizing advanced cost management, leveraging supply competition, and encouraging Supplier value creation. - b3. Process and Operational Efficiency - refers to opportunities to improve key operational processes throughout the supply chain by improving transaction processing, managing costs, and increasing integration. - b4. Risk and Sustainability - refers to opportunities to increase predictability and minimize environmental impact by implementing sustainable buying and leveraging risk management practices. Details of the strategies (and associated levers) within each of the following areas are provided in the 'Strategy X Levers' tab of the 'Category Strategy' document explained in Table 2.2.3 . ## c. Step 3 - Finalize Initiatives and Execution Plan The 'Project Owner' identifies initiatives against various strategic levers and develops an 'Execution Plan' for each identified initiative. ## d. Step 4 - Develop Engagement Model with the Supplier Based on the category value chain identified during the 'External Market Analysis' ( Table 2.2.2), the 'Project Owner' determines the engagement model. The engagement model suggests the level at which the Supplier should be engaged as illustrated below: ## Figure 2.2.6 Engagement levels ## e. Step 5 - Develop Business Case The 'Project Owner' develops a business case at the category/sub-category level. Business case provides a quantitative estimate of the potential savings that can be achieved by executing all selected initiatives within a category/sub-category. The 'Project Owner' may upload additional documents to support the business case calculations. ## 5) Review 'Category Strategy' The 'Project Owner' uploads the completed 'Category Strategy' in the 'Category Strategy' folder in 'Documents\" tab of the 'Knowledge Project (Category Management)' for review by the 'Reviewers' as per the PDoA .

It may be created against either an approved 'Purchase Requisition (PR)' or a sourcing initiative in the approved 'Procurement Plan'. An approved 'Sourcing Request' leads to a 'Sourcing Project'. - A 'Sourcing Project' enables execution of all tendering related tasks including (but not limited to) creation of a 'Sourcing Strategy', creation, execution, and evaluation of the Sourcing Event, and preparation of 'Award Recommendation Report'. A 'Sourcing Project' may include one or more Sourcing Events. The Sourcing Event enables interaction between Procurement and Suppliers to obtain information or bids. Following are the types of Sourcing Events: 1. Request for Information (RFI) 2. Request for Proposal (RFP) 3. Request for Quotation (RFQ) 4. Reverse Auctions (eAuctions) A Sourcing Specialist/Lead is assigned as the \"Project Owner\" of the 'Sourcing Project' in 'SAP Ariba'. This assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead creates the 'Sourcing Request' against which the 'Sourcing Project' is created and executed. In case of an Entity Specific Category, the 'Project Owner' is from the Entity managing the category while in case of a Common Category, the 'Project Owner' is from the GPO. ## 2.3.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes ## 2.3.3.(I) Prepare and Approve 'Sourcing Request (SR)' ## i.

The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead creates an SR in the 'Sourcing Module' against an approved PR. - a2. Details of the approved PRs are downloaded from 'ORACLE ADERP' and added in the SR. Additional details may be added as an attachment in the SR for review and approval. - a3. Multiple PRs may be aggregated into a Single SR, or a single PR may be split across multiple SRs, as required. Important Note: Approved PR is verified by the Procurement against existing contracts and inventories to identify if the requirement can be fulfilled without entering into new obligations. Important Note: The approved procurement requirement is not to be split into multiple SR to bypass approval authorities. Any split must be documented and approved by the Head of Procurement. - b. Create SR against sourcing initiatives in the approved 'Procurement Plan' The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead can create an SR based on a sourcing initiative identified in the 'Procurement Plan' and provide required details. The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead can create an SR by selecting 'Sourcing Request' from the 'SAP Ariba Dashboard' and completing the 'Overview Form'. The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead provides UNSPSC Level 2 category in the 'Commodity' field in the 'Overview Form'. The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead may link the 'Sourcing Request' to a previously executed 'Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)' or 'Sourcing Request' by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' in the 'Overview Form'. This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'. In case, the 'Sourcing Request' created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed 'Sourcing Request' the assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) 'Overview Form' details, and if required, 'Project Groups' and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current 'Sourcing Request'. The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead specifies the 'Sourcing Method' in the 'Overview Form'. ## 2) Select the 'Sourcing Method' The 'Project Owner' selects the type of the 'Sourcing Method' to be used for the 'Sourcing Project'.

However, they must be registered in the 'SAP Ariba Network'. Important Note: Sole/Single source should only be selected as the last option, and Procurement must endeavor to suggest suitable alternatives wherever possible. In case the assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead selects the Single/Sole source as the 'Sourcing Method' or deviates from the 'Sourcing Method' prescribed in the PDoA, the rationale and business case for the same must be provided for approval. Recommended Sourcing Method, in relation to the tender value, have been specified in the PDoA . The SR gets activated once the 'Overview Form' is submitted by the assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead . This assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead becomes the 'Project Owner' of the SR automatically. ## 3) Add Procurement Manager The 'Project Owner' assigns the Procurement Manager . The Procurement Manager is responsible for providing oversight of the S2C processes and ensure execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations. ## 4) Add SR Line Items/additional documents The 'Project Owner' edits the SR attributes and provide line-item details. If the SR has been created from an approved PR, this information is imported from the PR. The 'Project Owner' may submit additional documents (e.g., SOW) with the SR for review and approval. ## 5) Obtain all approvals for SR The completed SR is reviewed and approved by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA . 'Approval' tasks are initiated automatically in 'Sourcing Module' once all predecessor tasks are 'Completed'. If 'Approvers' reject the SR, they must provide a valid justification to the 'Project Owner'. The 'Project Owner' makes the recommended modifications and re-submits the SR for approval.

Any deviation from the recommended 'Project Types' must be accompanied by a valid justification and should be approved by relevant authorities as per the PDoA . ## 3) Select the 'Event Type' Following are the 'Event Types' enabled in \"SAP Ariba\": ## a. Request for Information (RFI) Used to gather information (market/spend/ Supplier base) or to shortlist Suppliers for RFP/ RFQ. ## b. Request for Proposal (RFP) Used for seeking proposals from Suppliers ; best suited for services or cases where the Procurement relies on the experience and creativity of Suppliers to define the best solution. RFP may be followed by RFQ or negotiations. ## c. Request for Quotation (RFQ) Used for seeking pricing information for a well-defined scope of work or supply of specified goods/services/projects, usually preferred for commoditized goods/services/projects where substitutes/ alternatives are allowed. ## d. Reverse Auction (eAuction) Used as an alternative to the RFQ for highly commoditized goods/services, or where participating Suppliers have fully acknowledged specifications (substitutes/alternatives not allowed); usually multiple Suppliers are invited to participate in eAuctions to maximize savings. During eAuctions, the Suppliers can see their relative ranking and can adjust their bids in real-time. Important Note: The 'Project Owner' may select multiple Sourcing Events within a 'Full Sourcing Project,' depending on the requirement. However, only one Sourcing Event per 'Event Type' can be executed within a 'Full Sourcing Project' (e.g., 2 RFPs or 2 RFQs are not allowed). Important Note: The 'Project Owner' cannot run parallel Sourcing Events within a 'Sourcing Project'. There must only be a single 'Award Scenario' per 'Sourcing Project'. Important Note: The 'Project Owner' may keep an additional Sourcing Event (RFP/RFQ) in the 'Sourcing Project' to obtain and record post-negotiation responses from the Suppliers, if required. The 'Project Owner' may link the 'Sourcing Project' to a previously executed 'Sourcing Project' by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' in the 'Overview Form'. This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'.

Sourcing Event content may include (but not limited to): - d21. Event definitions, scope, terms, and conditions provide necessary information to participate in the Sourcing Event. - d22. Bid Bond ensures that the awarded Suppliers fulfill the commitments of the accepted bid. It is only required for Sourcing Events, which may result in binding commercial proposals. The provisions of the Bid Bond with respect to the tender value is illustrated in Figure 2.3.2 . Any deviation from the recommended provisions must be accompanied by a valid justification and should be approved by relevant authorities as per the PDoA . - Please refer to section 1.5 to review the list of Suppliers exempted from the Bid Bond submission. - d23.

(i) Create each line item in 'SAP Ariba'. 3. (ii) Upload the line item information using the 'SAP Ariba' preferred excel format. In this case, the commercial bids are provided, monitored, and evaluated within 'SAP Ariba', using the 'Bid Console' functionality (e.g., eAuctions). The 'Project Owner' may provide the commercial bid sheet in an excel format, which the Suppliers download, complete, and upload as part of the overall Sourcing Event response. The \"Project Owner', in collaboration with the End-User , may make all line items mandatory for Suppliers to respond. Important Note: At least one-line item must be added directly in 'SAP Ariba' to enable awarding of the event. (e.g., In case the Bid sheet is provided in the form of an excel file, the line item added in 'SAP Ariba' can be the 'Total Cost' to which the Suppliers must respond).

The 'Technical and Commercial Envelope' can be imported from the 'Sourcing Library' provided in 'SAP Ariba'. Important Note: Adding the 'Technical and Commercial Envelope' is mandatory for RFI and RFQ within a 'Quick Sourcing Project'. The \"Project Owner\" may modify the \"Pre-requisites', \"Main Content', and \"Scoring Methodology\" of the Sourcing Event as required. The 'Project Owner' may make a section/question within the Sourcing Event content mandatory for the Suppliers to respond. These sections/questions appear with a (*) mark in 'SAP Ariba'.

The 'Project Owner' is informed (via email) when a Suppliers accepts Sourcing Event prerequisites. The 'Project Owner' may monitor the same within the Sourcing Event. ## 2) Respond to Suppliers' queries/requests While responding to the Sourcing Event, Suppliers may seek clarifications or ask for additional information from the 'Project Owner'. All queries/requests for additional information by Suppliers appear in the \"Message\" tab within the Sourcing Event. The \"Message Board\" acts as a two-way communication channel between Suppliers and \"Project Owner\" during the execution of the Sourcing Event. Important Note: Responses provided by the 'Project Owner' are made available to all participating Suppliers to maintain transparency. The 'Project Owner' ensures that the identity of the Supplier seeking clarification is kept confidential. It is recommended to keep the \"Message Board\" open until awarding for the event is complete. ## 3) Modify Sourcing Event/ extend Sourcing Event timelines If required, the 'Project Owner' may modify a Sourcing Event, provided modifications made are compliant with the Procurement Standards. The 'Project Owner' cannot invite any new Suppliers while modifying a published event. Important Note: In case a new Supplier is to be added, the published event is cancelled, and another event published with the updated list of Suppliers identified for participation. This is considered a new Sourcing Event. The 'Project Owner' may extend Sourcing Event timelines under the following scenarios: - a. Modifications/additions have been made to the published Sourcing Event content, due to which Suppliers require additional time to respond to the event. - b. Suppliers have requested additional time to respond to the published event; There must be a valid justification for modifying a published Sourcing Event. This rationale is reviewed and approved by 'Approvers' as per the PDoA . Modifications made to the Sourcing Event must be uniform for all Suppliers . ## 4) Monitor the submission of Suppliers' responses The Suppliers must respond to the Sourcing Event in line with the terms and conditions of the Sourcing Event. Suppliers can revise their submitted responses, as long as the Sourcing Event is active. The 'Project Owner' can monitor the submission of Sourcing Event responses by the Suppliers within 'SAP Ariba'.

(e.g., RFQ within a 'Quick Sourcing Project'). Single-Stage evaluation may imply that only one of the evaluations is required. ## 2) Two-Stage Evaluation In a two-stage evaluation, commercial and technical evaluations are conducted in separate 'Envelopes'. In such cases, the commercial evaluations are conducted only for Suppliers that have qualified the technical evaluations. (e.g., RFP/RFQ within 'Full Sourcing Project') Important Note: In case of eAuctions, the 'Bid Console' functionality of 'SAP Ariba' can automatically indicate the lowest bid for all line items. Further evaluations for eAuctions, if required, is conducted outside 'SAP Ariba'. The purpose of the process is to conduct technical and commercial evaluations of Suppliers' responses, as required. ## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Task Figure 2.3.18 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Evaluate Sourcing Event ## 1) Open 'Technical Envelopes' For 'Full Sourcing Projects', the 'Project Owner' opens the 'Technical Envelopes' for initiating the technical evaluations. The 'Team Graders' receive a system-generated email when the 'Technical Envelopes' are opened. ## 2) Review pre-requisites for evaluation The 'Team Graders' must review and agree to the Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest before conducting the technical evaluation. These requirements are provided within the 'Review Conflict of Interest and Perform Technical Evaluation' task description. In case a \"Team Grader\" does not agree to the Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest, a valid reason for the same is provided to the \"Project Owner' via the comments section in the task. The 'Team Grader' leaves the task un-attempted in this case. In such cases, the \"Team Grader\" is replaced by the \"Project Owner\" upon recommendation of the respective function head. Replacement of the \"Team Grader\" is endorsed by the Head of Procurement , outside 'SAP Ariba'. The Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest are deemed accepted (automatically) by the 'Team Graders' when they complete the 'Review Conflict of Interest and Perform Technical Evaluation' task. ## 3) Conduct technical evaluations Following methods are provided in 'SAP Ariba' to conduct technical evaluations: - a. Grade by Content enables grading of each response, across Suppliers , within 'SAP Ariba'; this method may be used for comparative grading across Suppliers responses. - b. Grade by Participants enables grading of responses, one Supplier at a time . - c. Grade Offline Using Excel enables grading in an excel spreadsheet, outside 'SAP Ariba' The Technical Evaluation within 'Sourcing Module' is based on the 'Scoring Methodology' defined in the Sourcing Event. Important Note: In case of an RFI event, the Sourcing Event evaluation may result in a list of 'Screened and Shortlisted Suppliers' for subsequent Sourcing Events. ## 4) Conduct commercial evaluations In case of a two-stage evaluation, once the technical evaluation is completed, the 'Project Owner'",

Using additional Sourcing Event in the original 'Sourcing Project' As recommended in Reverse Auction (eAuction), the 'Project Owner' may use the additional Sourcing Event within the 'Full Sourcing Project' to obtain negotiated bids from the Suppliers. ## b. Post-negotiations Quick Project The 'Project Owner' may create an additional 'Quick Sourcing Project' (linked to the original SR) for Suppliers to provide negotiated bids. This is done by creating another 'Subproject' from the 'Documents' tab of the associated 'Sourcing Request'. Important Note: If another 'Quick Sourcing Project' is used to obtain negotiated bids, the original 'Sourcing Project' must be closed by changing the 'Project State' to 'Completed' in the 'Overview' tab. ## 2) Prepare, publish and execute the Sourcing Event In case, an additional Souring Event within the original 'Full Sourcing Project' is used for recording negotiated bids in 'SAP Ariba', the 'Project Owner' completes all activities specified in Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event for a 'Full Sourcing Project'. In case an additional 'Quick Sourcing Project' is created to record post-negotiations bids in 'SAP Ariba', the 'Project Owner' completes all activities specified for 'Quick Sourcing Projects' in Create 'Sourcing Project' and Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event. In either case, the 'Project Owner' may download the content of the original Sourcing Event and upload it in the new Sourcing Event. The Sourcing Event content can be modified in the new Sourcing Event, as required. Important Note: The 'Project Owner' must invite all Suppliers that participated in the negotiations to provide negotiated responses in the post-negotiations Sourcing Event. ## 3) Verify Suppliers' responses Detailed evaluations are not required for post-negotiations Sourcing Event. The 'Project Owner' reviews the updated bids to ensure that they are in line with negotiations conducted. ## iii.

'Award Recommendation Report' The 'Award Recommendation Report' summarizes the execution of 'Souring Project' and provides details of award. In case that the negotiations were not conducted, the 'Project Owner' creates the 'Award Recommendation Report' after the Sourcing Event evaluation and attach it along with the 'Award Scenarios' for approval by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA . In case negotiations were conducted, the 'Project Owner' creates the 'Award Recommendation Report' post-negotiations and attaches it along with the 'Award Scenarios' for approval by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA . The 'Documents' tab of the 'Sourcing Project' contains an 'Award Recommendation Report' document, which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the 'Project Owner'. Below is the structure of this document: Table 2.3.12 'Award Recommendation Report' in 'SAP Ariba' | Section Name | Description | |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | 1.

Important Note: In case of 'Quick Sourcing Project', the 'Award Recommendation Report' is provided in the 'Sourcing Library' from where it can be downloaded, completed, and attached with the 'Award Scenarios'. ## b. 'Award Scenarios' Creating 'Award Scenarios' is the process to allocate the line items to winning Suppliers in 'SAP Ariba'. This allocation follows through to 'Contract Workspace' and to 'Procure to Order (P2O) module' (once enabled). In case the 'Bid Console' functionality is used, the 'Project Owner' can define a criterion in 'Bid Console' to automatically allocate line items to the successful Suppliers . Alternatively, the 'Project Owner' may allocate line items manually. A line item may be split among winning Suppliers if required. Please refer to section 10.22 of the Procurement Standards to understand how to resolve a tie among Suppliers . Important Note: Approval of 'Awards Scenarios' is mandatory for 'Sourcing Project' completion in 'SAP Ariba'. ## 3) Obtain approvals for 'Award Scenario' and 'Award Recommendation Report' The completed 'Awards Scenario' and the 'Award Recommendation Report' are approved by the 'Approvers' designated as",

If 'Approvers' reject the 'Awards Scenario' and the 'Award Recommendation Report', they must provide a valid justification to the 'Project Owner'. The 'Project Owner' makes the recommended modifications and re-submits the 'Awards Scenario' and the 'Award Recommendation Report' for approval. As soon as the 'Approvers' approve the 'Awards Scenario' and the 'Award Recommendation Report', the 'Sourcing Project' automatically closes for any further modifications. ## 4) Communicate award to winning Suppliers. Once the 'Award Scenarios' are 'Approved', 'SAP Ariba' can automatically send a systemgenerated email to the winning Suppliers, providing them with the details of the line items awarded to them. The 'Project Owner' needs to enable this automated email when creating the 'Award Scenarios'. ## 5) Accept/reject the award The 'Project Owner' tracks the acceptance/rejection of the award by winning Suppliers . In case the winning Suppliers reject the award, the 'Project Owner' may take one of the following steps: ## a. Consider the next eligible Supplier for award The 'Project Owner' can create another 'Quick Sourcing Project' (linked to the same SR) where the next eligible Supplier is invited to provide final bids. Please refer to section 2.3.3. (VIII)-(2.3.3.(VII)ii) for the details of the process. ## b. Modify 'Sourcing Strategy' The 'Project Owner' cancels this Sourcing Event and modifies the 'Sourcing Strategy'. The Sourcing Events are created and executed following the newly approved 'Sourcing Strategy' to fulfil the requirements. The selected way forward is endorsed by the Head of Procurement . Important Note: If a 'Bid Bond Certificate' has been provisioned in the Sourcing Event, the \"Project Owner\" must inform the Finance to appropriate the Bid Bond for winning Suppliers who have rejected the award. The 'Project Owner' may recommend adding such Suppliers to the list of blacklisted Suppliers in the Supplier Master Database maintained by the DGS.

(B) Scope and Purpose Cancellation of a Sourcing Event/'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request' implies lost time and resources and should only be done as a last resort. However, in certain circumstances, it might be necessary to cancel a Sourcing Event/'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request'. Such scenarios may include (but not limited to): - 1) 'Sourcing Request' is no longer valid (requested goods/services/projects are not required anymore). - 2) Suppliers shortlisted for the Sourcing Event did not respond to the event. - 3) Suppliers responses to a Sourcing Event are invalid and cannot be evaluated. - 4) No agreement reached post-negotiations, and original bids are not acceptable. The purpose of this process is to cancel the Sourcing Event/'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request' in 'SAP Ariba', as required and inform the participating Suppliers . ## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks ## Figure 2.3.26 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Cancel Sourcing Event/'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request' ## 1) Add 'Cancel Sourcing Event' task The 'Cancel Sourcing Event' is not a default task within the 'Sourcing Project'. In case the Sourcing Event needs to be cancelled, the 'Project Owner' adds the 'Cancel Sourcing Event\" task via the 'Overview' tab. ## 2) Create and obtain approvals for 'Event Cancellation Request' The 'Project Owner' creates an 'Event Cancellation Request' and submit it for approval by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA . The 'Documents' tab of the 'Sourcing Project' contains an 'Event Cancellation Request' document, which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the 'Project Owner'. The 'Project Owner' may use the 'Event Cancellation Request' template provided in the 'Sourcing Project' or other approved template covering the required elements. ## 3) Cancel the Sourcing Event In case the 'Event Cancellation Request' is approved , the 'Project Owner' cancels the respective Sourcing Event in 'SAP Ariba'. The 'Project Owner' can cancel the event by updating the event details and marking the event 'Cancelled'. Important Note: In the case of 'Quick Sourcing Project', the 'Project Owner' executes the above process steps outside 'SAP Ariba'. The 'Approvers' for 'Event Cancellation Request' are same as the 'Approvers' for Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event process. ## 4) Send 'Event Cancellation Notice' to Suppliers 'Event Cancellation Notice' is the automated email sent to all participating Suppliers when the Sourcing Event gets cancelled. ## 5) Cancel 'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request' A 'Sourcing Project' should only be cancelled if all events within the 'Sourcing Project' are cancelled. Similarly, a 'Sourcing Request' should be cancelled only if all 'Sourcing Projects' associated with the 'Sourcing Request' are cancelled. 'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request' can be cancelled by changing the respective status in the 'Overview' tab. The 'Project Owner' must obtain relevant approvals as per the PDoA before cancelling a 'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request'. These approvals are managed outside 'SAP Ariba'. ## iii.

This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents and templates used, the outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the CLM processes. Below is an illustration of the CLM level 3 processes: ## Figure 2.4.1 CLM Procurement Processes (Level 3) The CLM process group interacts with the Supplier Performance and Relationship Management (SPRM) process group (to evaluate supplier performance against the contract) and the Requisition to Pay (R2P) process group (to manage associated downstream activities). Details of these processes are provided in 2.5 and 2.6 , respectively. Currently, Requisition to Pay (R2P) process group is managed in 'ORACLE ADERP'. Consequently, the procurement practitioners must switch between 'ORACLE ADERP' and 'SAP Ariba', as illustrated below: Figure 2.4.2 Procurement processes across 'ORACLE' and 'SAP Ariba.' Below is an illustration of the process once the Requisition to Pay (R2P) process group is enabled through 'SAP Ariba': Figure 2.4.3 Procurement Processes - 'SAP Ariba' ## 2.4.2 'SAP Ariba Module' Overview The CLM process group is enabled through the \"SAP Ariba Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) module\". Each contract associates to a 'Contract Workspace' (in the 'CLM module') which has predefined 'Tasks', 'Team Members', 'Documents', and approval chains configured to enable efficient creation and management of any contract. The CLM processes are executed in the 'Contract Workspace,' as illustrated below: ## Figure 2.4.4 CLM processes and 'SAP Ariba' stages The Publish Contract enables the creation, review, approval, and publishing of the contract in the 'Contract Workspace'. The Manage Contract enables the management of contract amendments, claims, penalties, and disputes that may arise during the lifecycle of the contract. The Close Contract enables the closure/termination of the 'Contract Workspace' and completion of associated tasks. A Contracting Specialist/Lead is assigned as the \"Project Owner\" of the 'Contract Workspace'. For a 'Contract Workspace' created against an Entity-Specific Category, the 'Project Owner' is from the Entity managing the category. For a 'Contract Workspace' created against a Common Category, the 'Project Owner' is from the GPO. The 'Contract Workspace' for call-off contract (executed pursuant to the",

(B) Process Flow and Key Tasks Create 'Contract Workspace' Select the 'Contract Domain' Select the 'Hierarchical Type' Select the 'Term Type' Add/update 'Contract Folder' documents Assign 'Team Members' ## Figure 2.4.5 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Initiate and Review Contract ## 1) Create 'Contract Workspace' A 'Contract Workspace' can be created in following ways: ## a. From 'Sourcing Project' (Post 'Awards Scenario' approval) This is the preferred method for creating a 'Contract Workspace' that is linked to a 'Sourcing Project'. Once the 'Awards Scenario' is approved, the 'Project Owner' of the 'Sourcing Project' creates a 'Contract Workspace', completes the 'Overview Form' to create the 'Contract Workspace'. In this case, the 'Project Owner' of the 'Sourcing Project' marks the assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead as the 'Project Owner' of the 'Contract Workspace'. Depending upon the number of winning Suppliers , multiple 'Contract Workspaces' may be created against a 'Sourcing Project'. In this case, each 'Contract Workspace' has the 'Main Contract Document' and 'Contract Line Item Details (CLID)' specific to the Supplier . Below is an illustration of the same: Figure 2.4.6: Link between 'Sourcing Module' and 'CLM module.' Review 'Contract Folder' documents ## b. From 'Sourcing Project' (during the creation of the Sourcing Event itself) This method of creating a 'Contract Workspace' is preferred when the 'Project Owner' (or associated 'Contract Manager') of the 'Sourcing Project' believes that the review of the 'Main Contract Document' requires significant time and can be done alongside the 'Sourcing Project' execution. Please refer to section 2.3.3.(IV)ii.2) for details. ## c. From the 'SAP Ariba Dashboard' The assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead creates a 'Contract Workspace' from 'SAP Ariba Dashboard' by selecting 'Contract Workspace (Procurement)' from 'SAP Ariba Dashboard' and completing the 'Overview Form'. The assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead provides UNSPSC Level 2 category is provided in the 'Commodity' field in the 'Overview Form'. The assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead may link the 'Contract Workspace' to a previously executed 'Contract Workspace' or 'Sourcing Project' by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' field in the 'Overview Form'. This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'. In case, the 'Contract Workspace' created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed 'Contract Workspace', the assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) 'Overview Form' details, and if required, 'Project Groups' and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current 'Contract Workspace'. The assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead selects the 'Contract Domain', 'Hierarchical Type', and 'Term Type' while completing the 'Overview Form' as explained below. Important Note: 'Contract Workspace' cannot be created against Suppliers with 'Disqualified' status in the Supplier Master Database, maintained by the DGS. ## 2) Select the",

        "chunk_content": "'Contract Domain' The contract can be a Goods contract, Services contract, or a Capital Projects contract. ## 3) Select the 'Hierarchical Type' Contract hierarchies are used to organize and view related contracts, to combine pricing terms across selected contracts, and to roll up accumulated spend amounts throughout the hierarchy. The 'CLM module' enables the 'Project Owner' to organize contracts into hierarchies where a master agreement (also known as framework agreement) is the parent to one or more subagreements (also known as call-off contract). The stand-alone agreement is a contract that is not part a contract hierarchy and is executed by the Entity for its own requirements. Below is an illustrative example of contract hierarchy: ## 'FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT' ## MANAGEMENT PLAN Contains elements common to multiple Entities e.g., pricing (3AED per apple), guarantees, overall terms and conditions Contains elements specific to each Entity e.g., delivery locations (Corniche 1), authorized requesters, SLAs Contains delivery request(s) issues by each Entity defining date(s), quantity etc. in line with the provisions on FA and call off contract. e.g., PO for entity 1 for 3 apples at 3AED each to be delivered at Corniche Figure 2.4.7: Master Agreement - Sub-agreement Hierarchy type As illustrated above, multiple sub agreements may roll up to a master agreement. The Entity/department executing the sub-agreement raises the Purchase Orders (PO) against the same. Important Note: The Entity/department executing the sub-agreement owns the management of the sub-agreement. The Entity/department can make necessary amendments or manage any Claim/Penalty/Dispute for the sub-agreement. Depending upon the type of agreement, suitable 'Hierarchical Type' is selected in the 'Overview Form'. If the sub-agreement is selected as the 'Hierarchical Type', the 'Project Owner' must provide a master agreement reference in the 'Overview Form'. Important Note: Master agreement and sub-agreements are managed via different 'Contract Workspaces' in 'SAP Ariba'. ## 4) Select the 'Term Type' The following are 'Term Type' available in a 'Contract Workspace': - a. Fixed - A fixed-term contract is a contractual relationship between a Supplier and an Entity/GPO that lasts for a specified period. - b. Auto-Renew - Auto-Renew contracts may automatically extend past the expiration date. When using Auto-Renew, the 'Project Owner' specifies renewal interval and the maximum number of renewals. The 'Contract Workspace' gets activated when the 'Overview form' is completed and submitted by the assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead .

The 'Project Owner' can add members to this group but cannot modify the existing members. ## b. 'System Groups' 'System Groups' are groups of participants pre-determined for a 'Contract Workspace' (e.g., 'Approvers' and 'Reviewers'). The 'Project Owner' can add members to the 'System Groups' but cannot modify the existing members. ## 6) Add/update 'Contract Folder' documents The 'Documents' tab of the 'Contract Workspace' contains a 'Contract Folder'. The 'Contract Folder' is the key document folder that is shared with the 'Reviewers' and 'Approvers' at every stage. It may contain the following documents, depending upon the nature of the contract: ## a. 'Main Contract Document' The 'Main Contract Document' is the legal document that defines the basis of the contract, including both parties' roles, responsibilities, and a detailed description of the work. The 'Main Contract Document' could be the master agreement, sub-agreement or stand-alone agreement. The 'Project Owner' may use the 'Main Contract Document' templates provided in 'SAP Ariba Contracting Library' or other approved template covering the required elements. Important Note: The 'Main Contract Document' may include the provision for a Performance Bond for the Supplier. Please refer to section 1.5 to review the exceptions to the Performance Bond. ## b. 'Contract Line Item Details (CLID)' The line items associated with the contract are created and managed in the 'Contract Workspace' as 'Contract Line Item Details (CLID)'. These may include information regarding (but not limited to) specifications, unit of measure (UOM) and prices. In case the 'Contract Workspace' is linked to a 'Sourcing Project', the 'Project Owner' imports the 'CLID' from the 'Sourcing Project' directly. In case the 'Contract Workspace' is not linked to a 'Sourcing Project', the 'Project Owner' creates 'CLID' within the 'Contract Workspace' in the following ways: - b1. Create 'CLID' directly in 'SAP Ariba'. - b2. Download, complete, and upload the 'CLID' excel template. ## c. 'Termination Notice' The 'Termination Notice' is a legal notice to the Supplier confirming the termination of a contract. The 'Termination Notice' should always be prepared in collaboration with the Legal . This document is available in 'Contract Folder' tab once the 'Termination' amendment is triggered. ##",

Supplier performance against the contract through 'SPM Project' - b. Status of contractual obligations to estimate the contract closure - c. Upcoming contract expiry In case the 'Expiration Date' of the contract approaches (before all contractual obligations are met), the 'Project Owner' may extend the 'Expiration Date' to allow the Supplier to meet all contractual obligations, provided such an extension is requested by Contract Administrator and has been duly approved. If relevant provisions exist in the contract, the 'Project Owner' may renew the contract after obtaining required approvals. The process for 'Extension/Renewal' amendment is explained in section 2.4.3.(IV). In case the contract is not to be renewed or extended, either the 'Project Owner' closes the 'Contract Workspace', or the 'Contract Workspace' automatically expires as per the initially set 'Expiration Date' (irrespective of the incomplete contractual obligations). ## 2) Complete 'Contract Closure Checklist' The 'Contract Closure Checklist' contains a comprehensive list of activities to be completed before the contract is expired or closed. The 'Project Owner' can download the 'Contract Closure Checklist' document from the 'Documents' tab of the 'Contract Workspace'. The 'Project Owner' completes and uploads the 'Contract Closure Checklist' in the 'Contract Folder' along with any relevant documents. ## 3) Edit 'Expiration Date', if required In case of 'Termination' amendment or contract early closure, the 'Project Owner' proceeds to modify the contract 'Expiration Date' and close the 'Contract Workspace' as required.

This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents and templates used, the outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the SPRM processes. Below is an illustration of SPRM Level 3 processes: Figure 2.5.1 SPRM Procurement Processes (Level 3) ## 2.5.2 'SAP Ariba Modules' Overview The SPRM processes are grouped into three distinct stages, enabled either through an 'SAP Ariba module' or managed offline. Below is an illustration of these stages and respective 'SAP Ariba modules' enabling them: | SPRM Stages | Segment Suppliers | Manage Supplier Relationship | Manage Supplier Performance | |--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------| | Enabled by | 'SAP Ariba Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' | (Offline Process) | 'SAP Ariba Supplier Performance Mgmt.

Monitor Supplier Performance | ## Figure 2.5.2 SPRM processes and 'SAP Ariba' stages Segment Suppliers is enabled through 'SAP Ariba Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)'. A 'Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)' is created at the GPO level to categorize all Suppliers catering to Common Categories and at each Entity level to categorize all Suppliers catering to EntitySpecific Categories. An SRM Specialist is assigned as the \"Project Owner\" for 'Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)'. Manage Supplier Relationships enables development of collaborative relationships with selected Suppliers . It is executed at the GPO level for Suppliers catering to Common Categories and at each Entity level for Suppliers catering to Entity-Specific Categories. This stage is executed entirely outside 'SAP Ariba'.",

The Manage Supplier Performance enables evaluation, monitoring, and management of the Supplier performance against open contracts. It is enabled through the 'SAP Ariba Supplier Performance Management (SPM) Module'. For a Common Category contract, the 'SPM project' is created and managed by the GPO, and for an Entity-Specific Category contract, the 'SPM project' is created and managed by the respective Entity. The Contracting Specialist/Lead assigned as the 'Project Owner' of the original 'Contract Workspace' should be assigned the 'Project Owner' of the associated 'SPM project'. ## 2.5.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes ## 2.5.3.(I) Segment Suppliers ## i. (B) Scope and Purpose Segment Suppliers process is executed periodically, preferably once a year. The process of segmenting Suppliers into pre-defined groups (Strategic, Critical, Transactional, and Operational) enables the procurement to optimize and prioritize its efforts and focus on developing long-term relationships with the right Suppliers. Important Note: While segmenting Suppliers, it is crucial to consider the contracted spend with each Supplier for the same period to maintain a fair comparison. Suppliers that do not have contracted spend for the period of review may not be considered for Segment Suppliers process. The purpose of this process is to conduct the 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey' and prepare the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' in the 'Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)'. ## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks Create the 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' Assign Procurement Manager Prepare and publish 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey' Respond to the 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey' (Survey Participants) Prepare 'Supplier Segmentation Report' Obtain approvals of the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' ## Figure 2.5.3 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Segment Suppliers ## 1) Create the 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' The assigned SRM Specialist creates the 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' by selecting the \"Knowledge Projects' from 'SAP Ariba Dashboard', completing the 'Overview Form', and selecting the 'Supplier Segmentation Template'. The assigned SRM Specialist may link the 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' to a previously executed 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' field in the 'Overview Form'. This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in 'SAP Ariba'. In case, the 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)', the assigned SRM Specialist may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) 'Overview Form' details, and if required, 'Project Groups' and documents from the previously executed project Implement the Supplier Segment Strategy into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current 'Contract Workspace' The 'Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)' gets activated when the 'Overview Form' is completed and submitted by the assigned SRM Specialist . This SRM Specialist becomes the 'Project Owner' of the project. ## 2) Assign Procurement Manager The 'Project Owner' assigns the Procurement Manager in the 'Teams' tab. The Procurement Manager is responsible for providing oversight of the Supplier Segmentation process and ensuring execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards",

Survey Rules These rules define execution of the survey, such as: - a1. Timing Rules - define time-related parameters of the survey (e.g., Planned Start date and duration). ## b. Survey Participants Category Managers of the Entity-Specific Categories or Common Categories participate in the respective 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey'. For the categories, where the Category Managers are not assigned, Contract Administrators or End-Users involved in the category procurement participate in the survey. ## c. Survey Content The 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey' content includes a 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document, which needs to be filled by survey participants. Following is the structure of the document: Table 2.5.1 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document structure | Tab Name | Description | |---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | 1.

Scoring Guidelines | Reference tab; to provide 'Business Impact and 'Supplier Risk/Complexity' scores in the 'Data Inputs' tab | | 5. Category Taxonomy | Reference tab; to fill level 2 category in the 'Data Inputs' tab | ## 4) Respond to the 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey' The Supplier Segmentation depends on two parameters: - a. Business Impact of the Supplier implies how vital the Supplier is to business operations and future initiatives. - b. Supplier Risk /Complexity implies the dependence on the Supplier and ease of switching the Supplier , if required. The detailed criteria to score a Supplier on these parameters are provided in the 'Scoring Guidelines' tab of the 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document. A higher score implies higher business impact/complexity of the Supplier being evaluated. Scores on these two parameters serve as the criteria for segmenting the Supplier into one of the following segments: - b1. Strategic Supplier Strategic Suppliers are the Suppliers that show potential of innovation and collaboration. These Suppliers usually have a proven track record and are some of the highest spend Suppliers . An SRM Specialist is assigned to each Strategic Supplier to monitor and ensure execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements specified in b2. b3. Figure 2.5.5. Important Note: The Suppliers of Common Categories are considered as Strategic Suppliers by default, and GPO ensures execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements for these Suppliers. - b4. Critical Supplier Critical Suppliers are critical to everyday operations, and any failure by such a Supplier usually has a significant impact. An SRM Specialist is assigned to each Critical Supplier to monitor and ensure execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements specified in b5. - b6. Figure 2.5.5. - b7.

The following is an illustration of a Supplier Segmentation Matrix: Figure 2.5.4 Supplier Segmentation Matrix The 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey' is completed as follows: ## a. For categories with Category Managers The 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document is filled for each category by the respective Category Manager. The Category Manager identifies and scores each Supplier, on the above-explained parameters, within the category in the 'Data Input' tab of the document. The Category Manager may share this document with the relevant Contract Administrators/End-Users to collate required inputs. The collation of these inputs is managed entirely outside 'SAP Ariba'. The Category Manager collates the inputs into one 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document, with information on all Suppliers for the respective category. ## b. For categories without Category Managers The 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document is filled by the relevant Contract Administrators/End-Users. The survey participants upload the completed 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document in the 'SPM Project' as the survey response. Important Note: While collating data for their category, the Category Manager / Contract Administrator / End-User are advised to ensure that the entire contracted spend is accounted for in the 'Data Inputs' tab. ## 5) Prepare 'Supplier Segmentation Report' The 'Project Owner' downloads and collates the received survey responses in the 'Supplier Segmentation - Consolidated' document and modifies the 'Final Supplier Segment' tab. The 'Project Owner' can download the 'Supplier Segmentation Consolidated' document from 'Documents' tab. Important Note: The 'Project Owner' is encouraged to validate the spend figures of the Suppliers during collation of survey responses and adjust them if required. This 'Supplier Segmentation - Consolidated' document when completed forms the 'Supplier Segmentation Report'. Only one 'Supplier Segmentation Report' and should include all Suppliers . The key outcome of the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' is the Supplier Segmentation Matrix (illustrated in Figure 2.5.4) which provides a relative position of a Supplier . ## Important Note: All Common Category Suppliers are considered as Strategic Suppliers. ## 6) Obtain approval of the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' 'Project Owner' uploads the completed 'Supplier Segmentation Report' in 'Documents' tab for approval by the 'Approvers' designated as per the PDoA .

The Contract Administrator is one of the 'Supplier Performance Survey' participants and an 'Approver' of the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan'. ## b. 'System Groups' 'System Groups' are groups of participants pre-determined for an 'SPM Project' (e.g., 'Approvers' and 'Reviewers'). The 'Project Owner' can add members to the 'System Groups' but cannot modify the existing members. ## 3) Set up 'Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey' and 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' The 'Project Owner' sets up the 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' by assigning weightage/target grade to each KPI. The 'Project Owner' sets up the 'Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey' by completing the following segments: ## a. Survey Rules This segment specifies the rules for the execution of the survey, such as: - a1. Timing Rules - defines time-related parameters of the survey (e.g., Planned Start date and duration). ## b.

DELIVERY - Does the supplier deliver as per agreed schedule and quantities? - Was there a 'Out of Stock' situation due to the Supplier? - Does the Supplier offer flexibility in supply for any change in the demand? COST QUALITY - How competitive is the Supplier Pricing? - Does the Supplier suggest cost saving initiatives? - How transparent is the Supplier in terms of cost? - Does the Supplier adhere to agreed rates for the term of the contract? ## INNOVATION - Does the Supplier provide continuous improvement and innovation ideas? - Does the Supplier implement leading practices in their operations? - Has the supplier met SLAs of the contract? - Complaints recorder in past quarter for the Supplier ? - # of audit non-conformances in past quarter? - Has the supplier closed all corrective points? - Has the supplier maintained the quality certifications ? RISK AND COMPLIANCE - Does the Supplier comply with laws and regulatory requirements, manuals, company policies and procedures? - Are the Supplier's risk mitigation activities satisfactory? - Does the Supplier provide all delivery reports? - Does the Supplier comply with health, safety, and environment guidelines? ## Figure 2.5.11 Supplier Performance KPIs and default survey questions These six KPIs are fixed for all 'SPM Projects' and should not be deleted from any survey.

Weightage/target grade of KPIs - b. Questions within each KPI ## 4) Communicate performance goals to the Supplier The KPIs, criteria within each KPI, and frequency of performance evaluations are communicated to the Supplier outside 'SAP Ariba'. The 'Project Owner' marks the task 'Completed' after communicating with the Supplier . ## 5) Execute 'Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey' The 'Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey' gets automatically published as per the recurrence set by the 'Project Owner' while completing the 'Overview Form'. The 'Project Owner' is intimated about the upcoming survey to make any required changes to the survey rules, content, and participants, for the upcoming evaluation cycle. The survey participants must provide their responses against each question provided in the survey within 'SAP Ariba'. ## 6) Review and publish 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' 'SAP Ariba' generates the 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' based on the survey responses received, automatically. The 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' provides Supplier scores against each KPI and indicates the areas of improvement (KPIs where target grade is not met).

This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents and templates used, the outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the R&amp;R processes. Procurement risk is defined as a potential for failure of any of the procurement processes. Procurement risks may be associated with Supplier , supply chain, and procurement organization as illustrated below: Risks emerging from Suppliers ' end and are specific to Supplier (e.g., bankruptcies, location change, price increase, quality/delivery failure, mergers and acquisitions etc.) Risks emerging from unexpected external market events (e.g., environmental disasters causing supply chain disruption, price and supply volatility, supply shock, etc.) Risks emerging from internal processes/organization (e.g., incorrect approach to market, insufficient procurement resources, absence of category expertise, etc.) ## Figure 2.7.1 Sources of procurement risks Below is an illustration of the R&amp;R Level 3 processes: Figure 2.7.2 Risk and Regulations - Procurement Processes (Level 3) ## 2.7.2 'SAP Ariba module' Overview All R&amp;R procurement processes are enabled through the 'SAP Ariba Knowledge Project (Supply Risk)'. The R&amp;R processes are clubbed into three distinct stages, each of which is enabled through a different risk profiling type (sub-template) within the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk)' as illustrated below. | Risk and Regulations Stages | Profile Supplier Risk | Manage Procurement Risks | Manage Regulation Change | |-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------| | Risk Profiling type | 'Supplier Risk Profiling' | 'Mitigate Risk' | 'Regulation Change' | | Business Processes | 1.

Survey Participants The Category Managers participate in the 'Supplier Risk Input Collection Survey'. For the categories, where the Category Managers are not assigned, the Contract Administrators and End-Users participate in the survey. ## c. Survey Content The content of the survey includes a 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document, which is filled by all survey participants. Following is the structure of the document: | Tab Name | Description | |-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Supplier Risk Profile | To obtain details regarding Supplier risk profiles from survey participants and identify high-risk Suppliers. | | Risk Profiling Criteria | Reference tab; provides detailed criteria to score the Supplier on Financial, Operational, Environmental, and Legislative Impacts in 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab. | | Category Taxonomy | Reference tab; to add level 2 category details in 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab. | ## Table 2.7.1 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document structure ## 3) Respond to 'Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey' The Supplier risk profile is determined by assessing following types of Supplier risks: - a. Financial Risk - b. Operational Risk - c. Environmental Risk - d. Legislative Risk The detailed evaluation criteria for these risks is provided in the 'Risk Profiling Criteria' tab of the 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document. A higher score implies higher associated risk. Suppliers are evaluated on above mentioned risk types on a five-point scale (0 - No risk, 1 - Low Risk, 2- Medium risk, 3 - High risk, and 4 - Significant risk). Suppliers with a score of 3 (or above) on any of the risk types are considered as high-risk Suppliers . The 'Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey' is completed as follows: ## a. For categories managed by Category Managers The 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document is filled for each category by the respective Category Manager. The Category Manager identifies and assesses the Supplier risk in the 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab of the document. The Category Managers may share this document with the relevant Contract Administrators and End-Users to collate required inputs. The collation of these inputs is managed outside 'SAP Ariba'. In such cases, the Category Manager collates these inputs into one 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document. ## b. For Categories without Category Managers The 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document is filled by the relevant Contract Administrators and End-Users. The survey participants upload the completed 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document in the 'Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling' as the survey response. Important Note: While collating data for their category, the Category Manager / Contract Administrator / End-User are advised to ensure that the entire contracted spend is accounted for",

Below is an illustration of the Supplier MDM processes: Figure 2.8.1 Supplier MDM - Procurement Processes (Level 3) ## 2.8.1.(I) Supplier Classification The onboarding process of a Supplier varies with the type of Supplier . Suppliers can be broadly classified into the following two categories: ## i. Abu Dhabi Suppliers (AD-DED) This category includes Suppliers that operate in the Abu Dhabi &amp; have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license. ## ii. Non-Abu Dhabi Suppliers (Non-AD-DED) This category includes Suppliers that do not have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license. Such Suppliers may further be classified into: - 1) Local Suppliers (UAE Mainland and Freezone) - 2) Foreign Suppliers The Supplier Registration Team , at the Department of Government Support (DGS), is responsible for onboarding Suppliers and maintaining the Supplier Master Database. ## 2.8.2 'SAP Ariba Module' Overview The Supplier MDM process group is enabled through the 'SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance (SLP) module'.

Reactivate Suppliers | The Registration Request enables Suppliers or Entities to raise the 'Registration Request'. It enables identification of duplicate requests. The Supplier Registration enables Suppliers to complete and submit the 'Registration Questionnaires' to be reviewed by the Supplier Registration Team . Registration of a Supplier in the Supplier Master Database is necessary for the Supplier to participate in Limited Tenders. The Supplier Qualification enables Suppliers to complete and submit the 'Qualification Questionnaire' to be reviewed by the Supplier Registration Team . Qualification of a Supplier in the Supplier Master Database is necessary for the Supplier to conduct business activities, including (but not limited to) receiving award, PO and submitting invoices. The Supplier Qualification also includes process to disqualify a Supplier , if required. Suppliers can be blacklisted through the disqualification process. The Supplier Deactivation/Reactivation enables the Supplier Registration Team to deactivate/reactivate the Suppliers , as required. A 'Deactivated' Supplier is not eligible to conduct any business activity or participate in any Limited Tender. ## 2.8.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes ## 2.8.3.(I) Initiate Supplier Request ## i.

Non- AD-DED Suppliers request an Entity to raise an 'Entity Raised Supplier Request', on their behalf. In such cases, the Entity user logs into 'SAP Ariba Supplier Entity-Request Page', completes and submits the 'Entity Raised Request Form', and uploads the required documents. The Entity user should validate the information provided by the Supplier before submitting the request and confirm that the business requirements which are met by the Non - AD-DED Supplier cannot be met by a Supplier that holds an Abu Dhabi DED license. The Entity user , while completing the 'Entity-Raised Request Form' must confirm the expected spend with the Supplier . In case of Foreign Suppliers , this expected spend decides the attestation requirements. ## 2) Receive and assign 'Registration Request' The Supplier Registration Team Lead , upon receiving on the 'Registration Request', assigns the request to a Supplier Data Management Specialist for review and approval. ## 3) Review and approve/deny 'Registration Request' The Supplier Data Management Specialist reviews the 'Registration Request' for the following: - a. Duplicate 'Registration Request' 'SAP Ariba' automatically highlights if the received 'Registration Request' is a duplicate and highlights potential matches using the following fields: 2. a1. 'Company Name' 3. a2. 'Commercial/Industrial License Number' 4. a3. 'Tax Registration Number' In case 'SAP Ariba' highlights potential matches for a 'Registration Request', the Supplier Data Management Specialist checks for the following points, across potential duplicates: - b. Suppliers with the same 'Company Name' appear as potential matches in 'SAP Ariba' . In this case, the Supplier Data Management Specialist should compare the 'Commercial/Industrial License Number' and 'Tax Registration Number' with that of the potential matches to determine if the 'Registration Request' is a duplicate. - c. Suppliers related to each other (e.g., parent and child companies) may have the same 'Tax Registration Number'. Such Suppliers appear as potential matches in 'SAP Ariba'. In such cases, the Supplier Data Management Specialist should compare the 'Commercial/Industrial License Number' with that of the potential matches to determine if the 'Registration Request' is a duplicate. Important Note: Different 'Commercial/Industrial License Number' implies a different Supplier. A Supplier with multiple commercial/industrial licenses raises a separate 'Registration Request' for each of the commercial/industrial license. Based on the above activities, the Supplier Data Management Specialist determines if the 'Registration Request' is a duplicate and reject the same in such cases. In case 'SAP Ariba' does not highlight a duplicate for a 'Registration Request', the Supplier Data Management Specialist proceeds to further evaluation of the 'Registration Request'. - d. Valid 'Registration Request' - In case the 'Registration Request' is not a duplicate, the Supplier Data Management Specialist validates if the information provided in the",

The Item Master Data provides accurate, consistent and complete record of goods/services procured across Entities. The responsibility for maintaining Item Master Data is centralized with changes to the records initiated by the Entities. Following guidelines must be adhered to during creation and maintenance of the Item Master Database: - 1) Records of Item Master Data are created for frequently purchased goods/services. - 2) Each item is identified by a unique code in the Item Master Data. - 3) The record of each item contains (but not limited to): - a. Item Code - b. Description - c. Item type - d. Item group - e. Unit of Measurement - f. Unit price. - 4) Each item belongs to one of the UNSPSC Level 3 'Classes'. UNSPSC classification is explained in section 1.2.2 . - 5) Item Master Database is regularly cleansed to identify and remove duplicate records and rectify incomplete and inconsistent records, to ensure data integrity. ## 2.9.2 Details of the level 3 Processes ## 2.9.2.(I) Add/modify/Delete Item record Entity requestor can raise a request to add/modify an item record in the Item Master Data though GPO Helpdesk. The raised request must be approved by the supervisor of the requestor. The Helpdesk forwards the request to the Item Master Data team. The Item Master Data team reviews the raised request for completeness, accuracy, and duplication. In case the request is duplicate, the Item Master Data team rejects the request and communicate the same to the GPO helpdesk. The GPO helpdesk communicates the same to the Entity requestor. In case the request if inaccurate or incomplete, the Item Master Data team seeks additional information from the Entity requestor (through Helpdesk). If case the request is accurate, complete, and valid, the Item Master Data team obtains required approvals as per the PDoA to create/modify/delete the record, depending upon the request. Once approved, the Item Master Data completes executes the request in the Item master Data and communicates the same to the GPO Helpdesk. The GPO Helpdesk communicates",

Figure 1.2.1 Procurement Capability Model The Government Procurement Office (GPO) is established to fulfil the following objectives: - a) Acting on behalf of the Entities to consolidate demand for achieving economies of scale. The GPO is authorized to manage and execute sourcing for Common Categories. - b) Providing shared services such as Supplier Registration, Item Master Management, User Master Management, and Training. - c) Maintaining the Procurement Framework ensuring a standardized and efficient way of working of the Procurement . - d) Developing and operating the information technology platform for government procurement (eGate). - e) Running market development initiatives and managing partnerships with the private sector in coordination with the relevant authorities. Entity Procurement is responsible for procurement of the Entity-Specific Categories including sourcing, contracting, ordering, and managing Supplier performance. The Entity Procurement utilizes the shared services provided by the GPO. The GPO engages stakeholders from the Entities and dedicated Finance , Legal or other resources as needed for procuring Common Categories. The Entity Procurement engages End-Users and dedicated Finance , Legal or other resources for procuring Entity-Specific Categories. ## 1.2.1 Category Classification Classification of a category as a Common Category or an Entity-Specific Category depends on the category spend value and its commonality across Entities. A category that is procured by five or more Entities may be considered as a Common Category. Figure 1.2.2 Common vs. Entity Specific Categories ## 1.2.2 Category Taxonomy Category taxonomy refers to a hierarchical assignment of goods/services. In line with global best practices, UNSPSC (United Nations Standard Products and Services Code) taxonomy is recommended to be adopted by GPO and Entity Procurement . UNSPSC is a four-level taxonomy with each record represented with an eight-digit number and unique name, illustrated below: ## Figure 1.2.3 UNSPSC Categorizations The four primary levels of the UNSPSC are Segment, Family, Class, and Commodity. Each level is identified by two digits, that constitute together an overall eight-digit code. Standard categorization of goods/services/projects may be used for: - a) Consolidation of demand requirements - b) Development of 'Category Strategy' - c) Segmentation of Suppliers , and - d) Identification of Supplier risk profiles. Best practice templates provided for these processes already include UNSPSC taxonomy. All Abu Dhabi DED activities are mapped to Level 2 UNSPSC categories. A comprehensive 'DED -UNSPSC Mapping Report' is provided in Section 2.2.3 for reference. ## 1.3 Procurement Capability Model The Procurement Capability Model comprises of four types of procurement capabilities: Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support as illustrated below: | Strategic | Procurement Strategy | Procurement Strategy | Demand and Category Management | Demand and Category Management | |-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------| | Tactical | Source to Contract Contract | Source to Contract Contract | Lifecycle Management | Supplier Performance and Relationship Management | | Operational | Requisition to Pay | Requisition to Pay | Requisition to Pay | Requisition to Pay | | Support | Risk and Regulation | Supplier Master Data Management | Item Master Data Management | User Master Data Management | ## Figure 1.3.1 Procurement Capability",

Baseline Spend Baseline Spend is the foundation of the Procurement Benefits calculation. It is the value of addressable spend against which any benefit is measured. Establishing a baseline is the first step in the Procurement Benefits calculations process. ## 2. Classification of Procurement Benefits Procurement Benefits can be classified into Cost Reduction, Cost Avoidance, and Cash Impact. Details of the same are provided below: | | Cost Reduction 'same for less' | Cost Avoidance 'avoiding future cost' | Cash Impact | |------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------| | Definition | \u2022 Benefits that directly reduce the cost base compared to the baseline \u2022 Costs can be one-offs or recurring/sustainable | \u2022 Cost was not included in the original baseline \u2022 Action taken now to avoid future incremental costs \u2022 Could include initiatives that lead to cost reduction in the future | \u2022 One - time impact of increased cash | Table 1.4.1 Procurement Benefits Classification | Cost Reduction 'same for less' | Cost Avoidance 'avoiding future cost' | Cash Impact | |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | \u2022 Reduction in cost of software licenses resulting from optimization \u2022 A one-time saving such as a rebate or volume reduction in the prior year. | \u2022 Consumption reduced because of increase in efficiency or optimization \u2022 Price increase as a result of external factors, e.g. an increase in regulatory minimum wage, is offset by a reduced agency fee mark-up | Example \u2022 Cash impact due outstanding payables with Supplier (increased 'Payment Terms') \u2022 Sale or decrease inventory | | \u2022 Hard benefits (savings or additional revenue) vs Baseline Spend \u2022 Spend reduction year-over- year spend particular to the cost avoidance initiative demand optimization) \u2022 Cost avoidance comparing the variance in | \u2022 No increase in year-over-year relevant (e.g., demonstrated by volume and price. | Measurement \u2022 One - time impact demonstrated by estimating benefits. | ## 1.4.2 General Principles Following general principles apply to the calculation of Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits: ## 1. Baseline principles - i. An agreed baseline is required for Procurement Benefits calculations and must be signed-off by the relevant stakeholders from the End-User , the Finance and the Procurement . - ii. Baseline could be historic actuals (e.g., prior year spend, budgeted spend, etc.). - iii. The baseline must be supported by one or multiple data sets, such as Accounts Payable (AP) data, Purchase Orders (PO) data, Contracts data, etc. - iv. An appropriate method to calculate the Baseline Spend should be determined for each type of procurement benefit. ## 2. Procurement Benefits calculation principles - i. Procurement Benefits can be calculated after acceptance of a final, binding offer from one or more Supplier(s) and the acknowledgment of offer conditions (with written confirmation, Letter of Intent, contract amendment, etc.). - ii. Benefits implementation costs (one-time investments) are excluded from the benefits",

Baseline Spend Baseline Spend is based on two parameters and is calculated as following: Baseline Spend = Total Volume * Baseline Unit Price Total volume may be known or unknown. However, two methods can be used for calculations to estimate volume, as detailed: Table 1.4.2 Volume Estimation Methodologies | Method | Situation | Method | |-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Demand Plan Forecast Volume | Forecast is known | \u2022 100% of forecast volume for the specific spend area | | Historic forecast volume | Forecast is unknown | \u2022 50% of historic volume + (50% of historic volume * category demand growth forecast %) In general, previous year volumes are used as historic volumes; if this data is not available, the period that is used to calculate historic volume should be mentioned. | Baseline unit price may be estimated using one of the following methodologies: ## i. Historic price baseline Historic price baseline is relevant when the goods/services/projects were purchased previously (in last year). Below are the details of various methods to create a historic price baseline: Table 1.4.3 Historic Baseline Price Calculation Methodologies | Price Method | Situation | Method | |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------| | Used where market is not volatile (applicable for components and traded items like office furniture, etc.). | \u2022 Last actual paid price in the Purchase Order (PO), or \u2022 Contracted price, if last actual paid price is not available | Last Price Paid | | Used in case of a volatile market (applicable for e.g., 100% index-based commodities) | \u2022 Average Price paid over the last year | Average Price | | Used in case of a volatile market (Commodities for which transparent and independent index are not available) | \u2022 Average Price of historical offers after clarification from the Suppliers | Average quoted Market Price | ## ii. Comparable price baseline If a certain goods/service has not been purchased previously, historic price baseline cannot be established. In such cases, the baseline price can be estimated using comparable goods/services/projects (identical or similar specifications) where the price is known. (e.g., estimating the baseline price for a car rental service by comparing it with similar services previously purchased by another Entity). ## iii. New price baseline If neither a historic nor a comparable baseline can be established, a new baseline can be developed based on the initial RFI or RFP/RFQ responses provided by the Suppliers . The baseline price will be calculated as an average of the approved initial quotes. Any price reductions received through follow-on RFP/ auction/negotiation is considered as benefits. ## 2. Procurement Benefits As illustrated in Table 1.4.1 , Procurement Benefits are classified into three buckets: ## i. Cost Savings Following are the various Cost Savings scenarios: ## a. Standard Method (last paid price -new price) This method is used when the savings result from the difference between baseline and negotiated price. For example, when Suppliers are changed or when similar goods/services/projects are bundled, resulting in a better price per item. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings =",

        "chunk_content": "(baseline price -negotiated price) * volume ## b. Free of charges Extra These are the savings realized when contracts negotiated with Suppliers include 'extras' that have not been part of the goods/service offering of past purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = Savings from free of charge 'extra' per unit * volume ## c. Fluctuating market price with market Index This method of calculation is used when the cost savings can be attributed to a changing market index that results in a better future price (with respect to the market price). This method is applicable for commodities (crude oil, metals, Agri-commodities, etc.) where prices are linked to indices and change frequently. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = Forecasted spend with historical index value -forecasted spend with new index value ## d. Fluctuating market price without market Index This method of calculation is used when there are no market price references available. There may be no good benchmarks to indicate the savings w.r.t the market. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: Savings = (Initial offer -negotiated offer) * expected volume ## e. Volume Rebate This method of calculation is used when the Supplier offers rebates on volume or similar incentives, which have not been included in previous purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = (new rebate per unit -old rebate per unit) * volume ## f. Re-engineered specification (substitution) / rationalization For some goods/services/projects, the specification can be changed to reduce the price. New specifications examples may include (but not limited to) using black and white printers instead of coloured printers, using standard cars instead of high-end cars for rentals, and using standard event designs instead of specialized events. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = (Cost for original item/service -cost for substitute item/service) * volume ## g. In-house vs. Outsourcing For some categories, where services are provided in-house, outsourcing of services might be a viable option. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = (In-house cost (i.e. labor cost + material cost + overhead cost) -purchase price) x volume ## h. Lease vs. Buy For some categories lease of goods might be a viable alternative to buying (or vice versa). To compare the savings between leasing and buying options for goods, the cost per one unit needs to be calculated and compared. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = (Cost of purchasing per unit - leasing cost per unit) * volume ## i. Reduced Cost of Disposal At the end of their lifetime, some goods (e.g., Laptop) may be recycled. These costs need to be considered to determine the actual price of a product. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: Savings = Historic cost for disposal -new cost for disposal ## ii. Cost Avoidance Following are various Cost Avoidance scenario: ## a. Demand reduction/yield improvement This method of calculation is used when the volume of a defined goods/service has been reduced through",

Reduced cost of service This method is used to calculate the cost reductions for service (e.g., reduced maintenance cost through introduction of preventive measures). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: Savings = (Historic service cost -new service cost) ## iii. Cash Impact Following are the various Cash Impact scenarios: ## a. Inventory reduction This method is used when the involvement of Procurement leads to a reduction of inventories (e.g., stock) and results in significant cost savings. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: ## Savings = (Old Inventory levels -New Inventory levels) x WACC (WACC -Weighted Average Cost of Capital) ## b. Payment term extension This method is used when the involvement of Procurement results in a change of 'Payment Terms' and leads to a working capital improvement. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows: Savings = Working Capital Improvement = Average monthly invoice from supplier (VAT included) * New Payment terms (in days) / 30 * WACC (VAT -Value added tax; WACC -Weighted Average Cost of Capital) ## 1.5 Legislations applicable for Procurement ## 1.5.1 Abu Dhabi Local Content (ADLC) The Abu Dhabi Local Content Program aims to direct government spending towards the development of the local economy in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.

It explains the recommended approach and best practices for procurement operations. Figure 1: Procurement Framework STANDARDS GUIDELINES ## Definition of the Procurement The Procurement is the support function that ensures identification, sourcing, and access to optimal goods, services and projects that the government entities and its End-users require to fulfil their objectives. The Procurement exists to explore supply market opportunities and to ensure optimal implementation of the sourcing strategies that deliver the best possible supply outcomes for the government entity. The Procurement adds value and helps the government entity accomplish its objectives by deploying a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and address its needs collaboratively. The Procurement is executed through a series of activities spanning entire supply cycle from the understanding of requirements and evaluating the need for them, through identifying and analysing potential supply options, up to contracting with Suppliers and fulfilment of contracts. The Procurement runs continuously with ongoing management of relationships with the End-users, the Legal and the Finance, monitoring supply contracts and performance of Suppliers. ## Core Principles The Core Principles define key values and approaches for the effectiveness of the Procurement. The Procurement Practitioners of the government entity and every supplier engaged by it in procurement operations must adhere to the Core Principles when representing the government entity. The Procurement Framework establishes the following ten integrated Core Principles: - A Ability Develop procurement workforce with right capacity, capabilities and knowledge ensuring professionalism while providing attractive, competitive career options - B Accountability Support accountability through the establishment or enhancement of authorities and ensure internal and external control mechanisms are coordinated and integrated into procurement operations - C Digital Promote digital technologies and facilitate their adoption and development by enabling access to innovations and emerging digital solutions - D Effectiveness Drive cost-effectiveness and improvement in performance of the Procurement through economies of scale, specialisation, and continuous assessment - E Excellence Deliver efficiency and achieve greater value for money and high level of control through the development of streamlined processes and tools - F Fairness Facilitate access to procurement opportunities for potential Suppliers through establishing a fair regulatory framework and implementing transparency and open-door attitude - G Integration Support integration of the Procurement with relevant organisational functions",
