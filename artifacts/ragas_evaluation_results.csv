It explains the recommended approach and best practices for procurement operations. Figure 1: Procurement Framework STANDARDS GUIDELINES ## Definition of the Procurement The Procurement is the support function that ensures identification, sourcing, and access to optimal goods, services and projects that the government entities and its End-users require to fulfil their objectives. The Procurement exists to explore supply market opportunities and to ensure optimal implementation of the sourcing strategies that deliver the best possible supply outcomes for the government entity. The Procurement adds value and helps the government entity accomplish its objectives by deploying a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and address its needs collaboratively. The Procurement is executed through a series of activities spanning entire supply cycle from the understanding of requirements and evaluating the need for them, through identifying and analysing potential supply options, up to contracting with Suppliers and fulfilment of contracts. The Procurement runs continuously with ongoing management of relationships with the End-users, the Legal and the Finance, monitoring supply contracts and performance of Suppliers. ## Core Principles The Core Principles define key values and approaches for the effectiveness of the Procurement. The Procurement Practitioners of the government entity and every supplier engaged by it in procurement operations must adhere to the Core Principles when representing the government entity. The Procurement Framework establishes the following ten integrated Core Principles: - A Ability Develop procurement workforce with right capacity, capabilities and knowledge ensuring professionalism while providing attractive, competitive career options - B Accountability Support accountability through the establishment or enhancement of authorities and ensure internal and external control mechanisms are coordinated and integrated into procurement operations - C Digital Promote digital technologies and facilitate their adoption and development by enabling access to innovations and emerging digital solutions - D Effectiveness Drive cost-effectiveness and improvement in performance of the Procurement through economies of scale, specialisation, and continuous assessment - E Excellence Deliver efficiency and achieve greater value for money and high level of control through the development of streamlined processes and tools - F Fairness Facilitate access to procurement opportunities for potential Suppliers through establishing a fair regulatory framework and implementing transparency and open-door attitude - G Integration Support integration of the Procurement with relevant organisational functions\nThis chunk contains the cover page details, table of contents, introduction to the procurement framework, definition of procurement, and core principles of the Abu Dhabi Procurement Standards document.', '## 3.2. Types of Procurement - The Procurement is divided into the following three main types: A - A1. Procurement of goods - A2. Procurement of services - A3. Procurement of projects including capital assets - The procurement of goods, services and projects is facilitated through execution of the following: B - B1. Price List Agreements - B2. Contracts - B3. Orders The individual separation requires the approval of any performed activity by another individual. A - Segregation of duties requires separation of requestors or receivers and accounts personnel, as well as separation of requestors and approvers. B - The Procurement shall maintain an electronic audit trail documenting the segregation of duties for each sourcing event and each transaction. C. ## 3.7. Procurement Delegation of Authority - The Procurement Delegation of Authority, the PDoA, shall describe division of authority and powers in the government entity related to procurement operations. A - The PDoA must contain all the financial and non-financial authorisers related to all procurement activities. B Abu Dhabi Procurement Standards ## Section 4: Procurement Clients and Partners\nThis chunk outlines the different types of procurement (goods, services, projects) facilitated through price list agreements, contracts, and orders.

(B) Scope and Purpose The technical and commercial evaluations of a Souring Event are conducted in one of the following ways: ## 1) Single-Stage Evaluation In a single-stage evaluation, the technical and commercial evaluation is conducted together in a single \'Envelope\'. (e.g., RFQ within a \'Quick Sourcing Project\'). Single-Stage evaluation may imply that only one of the evaluations is required. ## 2) Two-Stage Evaluation In a two-stage evaluation, commercial and technical evaluations are conducted in separate \'Envelopes\'. In such cases, the commercial evaluations are conducted only for Suppliers that have qualified the technical evaluations. (e.g., RFP/RFQ within \'Full Sourcing Project\') Important Note: In case of eAuctions, the \'Bid Console\' functionality of \'SAP Ariba\' can automatically indicate the lowest bid for all line items. Further evaluations for eAuctions, if required, is conducted outside \'SAP Ariba\'. The purpose of the process is to conduct technical and commercial evaluations of Suppliers\' responses, as required. ## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Task Figure 2.3.18 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Evaluate Sourcing Event ## 1) Open \'Technical Envelopes\' For \'Full Sourcing Projects\', the \'Project Owner\' opens the \'Technical Envelopes\' for initiating the technical evaluations. The \'Team Graders\' receive a system-generated email when the \'Technical Envelopes\' are opened. ## 2) Review pre-requisites for evaluation The \'Team Graders\' must review and agree to the Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest before conducting the technical evaluation. These requirements are provided within the \'Review Conflict of Interest and Perform Technical Evaluation\' task description. In case a ""Team Grader"" does not agree to the Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest, a valid reason for the same is provided to the ""Project Owner\' via the comments section in the task. The \'Team Grader\' leaves the task un-attempted in this case. In such cases, the ""Team Grader"" is replaced by the ""Project Owner"" upon recommendation of the respective function head. Replacement of the ""Team Grader"" is endorsed by the Head of Procurement , outside \'SAP Ariba\'. The Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest are deemed accepted (automatically) by the \'Team Graders\' when they complete the \'Review Conflict of Interest and Perform Technical Evaluation\' task. ## 3) Conduct technical evaluations Following methods are provided in \'SAP Ariba\' to conduct technical evaluations: - a. Grade by Content enables grading of each response, across Suppliers , within \'SAP Ariba\'; this method may be used for comparative grading across Suppliers responses. - b. Grade by Participants enables grading of responses, one Supplier at a time . - c. Grade Offline Using Excel enables grading in an excel spreadsheet, outside \'SAP Ariba\' The Technical Evaluation within \'Sourcing Module\' is based on the \'Scoring Methodology\' defined in the Sourcing Event. Important Note: In case of an RFI event, the Sourcing Event evaluation may result in a list of \'Screened and Shortlisted Suppliers\' for subsequent Sourcing Events. ## 4) Conduct commercial evaluations In case of a two-stage evaluation, once the technical evaluation is completed, the \'Project Owner\'\nCombined Succinct Context:\nThis chunk outlines the process of evaluating supplier responses, including technical and commercial evaluations, within a sourcing event in the SAP Ariba system.

1.  **Performance Metrics:**  Vendors’ performance is tracked using “Supplier performance scores” (as highlighted in Chunk 3), monitored through the “Procurement Gate” (Chunk 1, A2), and assessed historically (Chunk 10, A6).

2.  **Technical Evaluation:**  Evaluations involve assessing technical responses using methods like “Grade by Content” or “Grade by Participants” within the SAP Ariba system (Chunks 4 and 5).

3.  **Commercial Evaluation:**  This includes scrutinizing bids for arithmetic errors, anomalies, pricing distortions, and unrealistic low offers (Chunk 10, A1 & A2). Clarifications are sought and required to ensure offers are valid.

4.  **Negotiation Outcomes:** The results of negotiations, including any changes to original or negotiated offers, are a critical factor in the overall evaluation (Chunk 10, A1 & A2).

5.  **Supplier Recommendations:** End-users can recommend registered suppliers, which the Procurement team is encouraged to consider (Chunk 10, A5).

6.  **Comprehensive Evaluation Summary:** The final award recommendation includes an evaluation summary of both technical and financial proposals, along with a summary of negotiation outcomes (Chunk 10, A1 & A2).

1. **Purchase Requisition (PR) Approval:**
   * An End-User initiates the process by submitting a Purchase Requisition (PR).
   * The PR is then reviewed and approved by Approvers (as per the PDoA).
   * The approved PR is then used as a basis for creating a Purchase Order (PO).

2. **Purchase Order (PO) Approval:**
   * Once a PO is created, it’s reviewed and approved by approvers designated as per the PDoA.
   * Modifications to the PO are also reviewed and approved, with the Procurement making changes and resubmitting for approval.

3. **Exceptions (No POs):**
   * When purchases don’t align with a standard PR/PO process (e.g., due to exempted goods/services), the Procurement still needs approval, typically through the PDoA.

4. **Invoice Reconciliation & Payment:**
   * After goods/services are received, invoices are reconciled against the PO and receipt. Finance then approves payment to the supplier.

5. **Category Strategy & Ongoing Review:**
   * The 'Category Strategy' itself is periodically reviewed and updated by the Category Manager, ensuring ongoing alignment with procurement goals.

**Key Approval Bodies:** The primary approval bodies mentioned are:

*   **Approvers (as per PDoA):**  For PR and PO approvals.
*   **Category Manager:**  For reviewing and updating the ‘Category Strategy’.

**Important Note:** The context emphasizes a layered approval process, with the goal of controlling spending and ensuring compliance.","Purchase requests must go through defined approval levels based on financial thresholds, with higher-value procurements requiring senior management or committee approval.",0.0,1.0,0.48

It explains the recommended approach and best practices for procurement operations. Figure 1: Procurement Framework STANDARDS GUIDELINES ## Definition of the Procurement The Procurement is the support function that ensures identification, sourcing, and access to optimal goods, services and projects that the government entities and its End-users require to fulfil their objectives. The Procurement exists to explore supply market opportunities and to ensure optimal implementation of the sourcing strategies that deliver the best possible supply outcomes for the government entity. The Procurement adds value and helps the government entity accomplish its objectives by deploying a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and address its needs collaboratively. The Procurement is executed through a series of activities spanning entire supply cycle from the understanding of requirements and evaluating the need for them, through identifying and analysing potential supply options, up to contracting with Suppliers and fulfilment of contracts. The Procurement runs continuously with ongoing management of relationships with the End-users, the Legal and the Finance, monitoring supply contracts and performance of Suppliers. ## Core Principles The Core Principles define key values and approaches for the effectiveness of the Procurement. The Procurement Practitioners of the government entity and every supplier engaged by it in procurement operations must adhere to the Core Principles when representing the government entity. The Procurement Framework establishes the following ten integrated Core Principles: - A Ability Develop procurement workforce with right capacity, capabilities and knowledge ensuring professionalism while providing attractive, competitive career options - B Accountability Support accountability through the establishment or enhancement of authorities and ensure internal and external control mechanisms are coordinated and integrated into procurement operations - C Digital Promote digital technologies and facilitate their adoption and development by enabling access to innovations and emerging digital solutions - D Effectiveness Drive cost-effectiveness and improvement in performance of the Procurement through economies of scale, specialisation, and continuous assessment - E Excellence Deliver efficiency and achieve greater value for money and high level of control through the development of streamlined processes and tools - F Fairness Facilitate access to procurement opportunities for potential Suppliers through establishing a fair regulatory framework and implementing transparency and open-door attitude - G Integration Support integration of the Procurement with relevant organisational functions\nThis chunk contains the cover page details, table of contents, introduction to the procurement framework, definition of procurement, and core principles of the Abu Dhabi Procurement Standards document.', '## 3.2.

Furthermore, a member of the Disciplinary Board must not have previously expressed an opinion on the subject of the investigation in any capacity whatsoever.
